<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The Junior High School offers exceptional opportunity for relating
literature to life. In addition to the aesthetic and ethical
purposes, long recognized in the study of literature, the World
War emphasized the need for an extension of aims to include the
teaching of certain fundamental American ideals. To marshal the
available material, setting it to work in the service of social and
civic ideals, is to give to literature the “central place in a new
humanism.” When we organize reading in the schools with reference
to the teaching of ideals—personal, social, national, and
patriotic—we “put the stress on literature as one of the chief
means through which the child enters on his intellectual and spiritual
inheritance.” Outstanding among these ideals are: freedom,
love of home and country, service, loyalty, courage, thrift, humane
treatment of animals, a sense of humor, love of Nature, and an
appreciation of the dignity of honest work. In a word, to provide
a course in the history and development of civilization,
particularly stressing America’s part in it, is the present-day
demand on the school.</p>

<p>The Junior High School Literature Series, of which the present
volume is intended for use in the first year, provides such a
course. The literature brought together in this book is organized
with reference to the social ideal. Nature in its varied
relations to human life, particularly child life, is presented in
stories and poems of animals, birds, flowers, trees, and winter, all
abounding in beauty and charm. Interest in Nature leads to interest
in the deeds of men filled with the spirit of adventure. The
heroism of brave men and women from the age of chivalry to
the days of self-sacrifice on Flanders Fields is told in ballad
and romance, thus stimulating qualities of courage, loyalty, and
devotion. Akin to these are the deeds of men who won freedom
for their fellows and gave meaning to the words, “our inheritance
of freedom.” Their heroism is told in story and song, from the
time of the Great Charter and Robert the Bruce to the Declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of Independence and the recent treaty of Versailles. The
whole culminates in the literature and life in the homeland, interpreting
America’s part in these great enterprises of the human
spirit. Through legend and history the spirit and thoughts of
our developing nation are portrayed in a literature of compelling
interest, distinctively American.</p>

<p>This book supplies material in such generous quantity as to
provide in one volume a complete one-year course of literature.
There is material suited to all the purposes that a collection of
literature for this grade should supply: reading for the story element,
silent reading, reading for expression, intensive reading,
memorizing, dramatization, public reading and recitation, plot
study, etc. Moreover, the book offers a wide variety of literature,
representing various types: ballads, lyrics, short stories, tales,
biographies, and the rest. The selections comprise not only those
that have stood the test of time, but also some of the choicest
treasures of the modern creative period. They are given in complete
units, not mere excerpts or garbled “cross-sections.”</p>

<p>The helps to study are more than mere notes; they take into
account the larger purposes of the literature. Especially illuminating
are the selection “The Three Joys of Reading,” pages <a href="#Page_9">9-14</a>,
and the Introductions to Parts <a href="#II_INTRO">II</a>, <a href="#III_INTRO">III</a>, and <a href="#IV_INTRO">IV</a>; these should be
read by pupils before beginning the study of the selections in the
several groups, for they interpret and give greater significance to
the units. The biographical and historical notes provide helpful
data for interpreting the stories and poems. A comprehensive
glossary, pages <a href="#Page_592">592-626</a>, contains the words and phrases of the
text that offer valuable vocabulary training, either of pronunciation
or meaning. An additional feature that will appeal to many
teachers is the list of common words frequently mispronounced
given in connection with the helps to study. See pages <a href="#Page_14">14</a>, <a href="#Page_26">26</a>, etc.</p>

<p>The picture on this page is called “A Reading from Homer.”
Study each of the people who form the group. Judging from their
dress and appearance, do you think they are people of the present
time or of the ancient world? From what sort of book is the poet
reading? Should you think such “books” could be owned by all
sorts of people, or only by a few? Study the reader’s expression.
What sort of story do you think he is reading? Can you decide
anything about the listeners, who they are and what they are
thinking about? Who is most deeply interested in the story, and
why?</p>

<p>Men do brave deeds on the sea, in far-off lands, or in war, and
these deeds are the subject of song and story. Youths who are
looking forward to heroic careers, and men and women to whom
life has brought few thrilling experiences, like to hear these tales.
A well-told story opens the door to a new pleasure in living. An
animal knows only the present. He is hungry, or tired, or his
life is in danger, or he is well fed and sleepy. But boys and girls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
and grown-ups, too, have not only their daily experience to draw
upon, but through books and magazines and papers they can
enter into the experience of others, so that they may live many
lives in one.</p>

<p>Aladdin had a wonderful lamp. By rubbing it he could be
anywhere he chose or could possess anything he desired. Such
a lamp the reader of good books possesses. You come in from
work or play, curl yourself up in a big chair before the fire, open
your book, and in a twinkling you are whisked away to a new
world. Your body is there, curled up before the fire, but enchantment
has come upon you. In imagination you are with Sindbad
the Sailor, or with Robinson Crusoe, or with King Arthur, or you
are in the Indian Jungle, or on a ship sailing the South Seas, or
you are hunting for Treasure Island. And you have it in your
power to take these wonderful trips instantly; no railway tickets
are required, no long delays. You may go on a journey to the
other side of the world or into the South Polar ice or out on a
western ranch. What is more wonderful, you may go back a
century, or ten centuries; through this Aladdin’s lamp of reading
you are master not only of space, but also of time. Thus the first
joy of reading is the privilege of taking part in the experiences of
men of every time and every portion of the world. You multiply
your life, and the product is richness and joy.</p>

<p>The second joy of reading is even greater. Not only the world
of adventure is open to you by means of books, but also a life
enriched by the wisdom that has been gathered from a thousand
poets and historians as bees gather honey from a thousand flowers.
There is a story of a great Italian of the sixteenth century who
found himself in the prime of life without a position, without
money, and even compelled to become an exile because of a revolution.
He retired to a farm remote from all the scenes in which
his previous life had been passed. All day he worked hard, for
only by hard work could he live. But in the evenings, when work
was done, when horses and oxen and the laborers who had toiled
with them all the day had gone to sleep, this man put on the splendid
court dress he had worn in the days of his prosperity, days
when he had associated with princes and the great ones of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
earth, and so garbed he went into his library and shut the door.
And then, he tells us, for four hours he lived amid the scenes that
his books called up before him. He found in books an Aladdin’s
lamp that transported him to past times, that revealed the secrets
of nature, that showed him what
men had accomplished. Through
history, he re-created the past.
He could call on the wisest of men
for counsel, and he forgot during
these hours his weariness and pain.</p>

<p>This story of the great Italian
has been paralleled many times.
There was once a boy in a frontier
cabin who had no such experience
as this man passed through
centuries ago, but who was eager
to know all that could be learned
about life. His days were long
and hard, but he was dreaming of
things to come. At night by the
light of the pine logs blazing in the
fireplace, this boy read and
studied. Books were hard to get; sometimes he tramped for miles
to borrow one that he had heard a distant farmer possessed.
Thus Lincoln found the second of the joys of reading, the stored-up
wisdom of the race that he appropriated against the day when
he was to be not merely a student of history but a maker of
history as well.</p>

<p class="caption">THE SONG OF THE LARK</p>
</div>

<p>The third joy of reading is that through books our eyes are
opened to the beauty of the world in which we live. There is
a famous painting called “The Song of the Lark.” A peasant
girl is on her way to work in the fields, sickle in hand, in early
morning. She has stopped to listen to the flood of melody that
pours from the sky above her, and is trying in vain to see the
bird which is singing the glorious song. Her dull, unexpressive
face is lighted up for the moment in the presence of a beauty
that she feels but does not comprehend. So the painter interprets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
for us the effect of beauty upon even a dull intelligence. But
the poet translates the song into beautiful language, and we
read and are happy.</p>

<p>Thousands of people pass unthinkingly by a field filled with the
common daisies. They know the name of the flower; they may
even say, or think, that the flowers make a pretty sight. But a
poor young poet plows one up on his farm and tells us of his
sympathy for the little flower he has destroyed; tells us, too, how
the fate of the daisy suggests to him his own fate, so that all who
read the poem by Robert Burns no longer see in the daisy a common
flower, but see instead a symbol of beauty.</p>

<p>Bird-song and flower, the west wind as it drives the dead leaves
before it or hurries the clouds across the sky or piles up in great
masses the waters of the sea; the mountain that rises stark and
stern above the plain, the ocean over which men’s ships pass in
safety or into whose depths they plunge to their grave—all these
things the poet helps us to see and to feel. So once more our
Aladdin’s lamp brings us into scenes of enchantment, multiplies
our lives, opens our eyes to things that the fairy-folk know right
well, but which are forbidden to mortal eye and ear until the spell
has worked its will.</p>

<p>These, then, are the three joys of reading: First, to be able to
travel at will in any country and in any period of time and to
taste the salt of adventure; to hear the great stories that the
human race has garnered through centuries of living; to know
earth’s heroes and to become a part of the company that surrounds
them. Second, to enter into the inheritance of wisdom that
has come down from ancient times or that animates those who are
the builders of our present world. “Histories make men wise,”
said one of the wisest of men, by which he meant that history
records the experience of men in their attempts to make the world
a place where people may dwell together in safety, and that as men
reflect on this experience they become wiser. And poets and prose
writers, too, have told in books what they have thought to be the
meaning of life. They are like the wise old hermits, dwelling in
little cabins by the edge of the enchanted forest, who told Sir
Galahad or Sir Gawain or Sir Lancelot about the perils of the forest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
and how to win their way to the enchanted castle where dwelt
the Queen.</p>

<p>And the third joy of reading is that which brings us knowledge
of this enchanted world. For it <em>is</em> a world of wonder in which we
live as truly as that fairy world which so delighted you when
Mother told you stories or when you read your fairy books. The
journey of Captain Scott in search of the South Pole was as thrilling
as the voyage of Sinbad. Those brave men who made the first
flight in an airplane across the ocean the other day were as
venturesome as Columbus, and their journey was as wonderful as
that journey in 1492. But Captain Scott did not leave his comfortable
and safe life at home merely to seek adventure. It was
an expedition planned in order that he might bring back exact
information about parts of the earth where men had never been
before. And the flight across the Atlantic was just one more step
in the development of a new form of transportation. So science
contributes in many ways to our happiness and safety. What
men do to develop the resources of the earth, what they do to
conquer disease, the inventions and discoveries that give us
greater power than if we possessed the open sesame of our fairy
stories—these also you learn about in your reading.</p>

<p>The book to which you are here introduced is planned in such
a way as to help you find these three joys of reading. It is a
big generous book, filled with good things. It is an Aladdin’s
lamp. Take it to your favorite big chair or to your favorite
corner and test it. Do you wish to get into the Enchanted Forest?
The very first selections, about animals and birds and growing
things, take you there where you will find friends old and new.
Do you wish to go on a long journey back to King Arthur’s time
and meet the knights of the Round Table? The power is yours
for the asking. Or if you prefer songs and stories of the sea, here
is a ballad that has been sung for centuries, or you may have
ballads about battles in the war that ended the other day. And
no one knew the secrets of the Enchanted Forest better than
William Shakespeare—here are two stories that he loved.</p>

<p>At some other time your book will take you back to the days
of Wallace and Bruce, or will bring before you some of the things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
England has done for Freedom, or will show you what Americans
of the old time did and thought when they were building their free
land for you to dwell in and to protect. And, last of all, there are
stories of life in our America—old legends and stories that will
make you smile, and stories of workers and their work. When
you have finished the last section you will be happier and a better
citizen, ready to do your share every chance you get.</p>

<p>One word more. You know that, in order to work enchantment,
people have had to do certain things. There was the fern-seed,
you know, or the charm like “open sesame,” or you have to rub the
wonderful lamp. Now to use this book rightly, you must not
think of it as a lesson book, containing tasks. If you do that, it
will be no Aladdin’s lamp at all but just a dull old smoky lamp
that would not even guide you to the cellar. You must do these
things: First, get that chair or that corner and make yourself
comfortable. Second, <em>look at the program</em>. What is that?
Why, the “Table of Contents,” of course. You must know where
you are going and what you are to see. In this book everything
is arranged in such a way as to help the charm to work. Third,
you will find little questions and studies every now and then, and
a glossary, guide-posts so that you will not lose your way. And,
last of all, you are to try to see the book as a whole and not as a
sort of scrapbook about all sorts of things. For it all deals, in
one way or another, with the Enchanted Forest and the Castle of
Life.</p>

<h4>THE BUFFALO</h4>

<p class="author">FRANCIS PARKMAN</p>

<h5>BRINGING HOME THE MEAT</h5>

<p>Four days on the Platte, and yet no buffalo! The wagons one
morning had left the camp; Shaw and I were already on horseback,
but Henry Chatillon still sat cross-legged by the dead
embers of the fire, playing pensively with the lock of his rifle,
while his sturdy Wyandot pony stood quietly behind him, looking
over his head. At last he got up, patted the neck of the pony
(whom, from an <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref1">exaggerated appreciation</a> of his merits, he had
christened “Five Hundred Dollar”), and then mounted with a
melancholy air.</p>

<p>“What is it, Henry?”</p>

<p>“Ah, I feel lonesome; I never been here before; but I see away
yonder over the buttes, and down there on the prairie, black—all
black with buffalo!”</p>

<p>In the afternoon he and I left the party in search of an antelope;
until, at the distance of a mile or two on the right, the tall
white wagons and the little black specks of horsemen were just
visible, so slowly advancing that they seemed motionless; and
far on the left rose the broken line of scorched, desolate sand-hills.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The vast plain waved with tall rank grass that swept our
horses’ bellies; it swayed to and fro in billows with the light
breeze, and far and near, antelope and wolves were moving through
it, the hairy backs of the latter alternately appearing and disappearing
as they bounded awkwardly along; while the antelope,
with the simple curiosity peculiar to them, would often approach
us closely, their little horns and white throats just visible above
the grass tops as they gazed eagerly at us with their round, black
eyes.</p>

<p>I dismounted, and amused myself with firing at the wolves.
Henry <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref2">attentively scrutinized</a> the surrounding landscape; at
length he gave a shout, and called on me to mount again, pointing
in the direction of the sand-hills. A mile and a half from us, two
minute black specks slowly traversed the face of one of the bare,
glaring declivities, and disappeared behind the summit. “Let us
go!” cried Henry, belaboring the sides of Five Hundred Dollar;
and I following <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref3">in his wake</a>, we galloped rapidly through the rank
grass toward the base of the hills.</p>

<p>From one of their openings descended a deep ravine, widening
as it <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref4">issued on the prairie</a>. We entered it, and galloping up, in
a moment were surrounded by the bleak sand-hills. Half of their
steep sides were bare; the rest were scantily clothed with clumps
of grass and various uncouth plants, conspicuous among which
appeared the reptile-like prickly-pear. They were <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref5">gashed with
numberless ravines</a>; and as the sky had suddenly darkened and
a cold gusty wind arisen, the strange shrubs and the dreary hills
looked <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref6">doubly wild</a> and desolate. But Henry’s face was all eagerness.
He tore off a little hair from the piece of buffalo robe
under his saddle, and threw it up, to show the course of the wind.
It blew directly before us. The game were therefore <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref7">to windward</a>,
and it was necessary to make our best speed to get round them.</p>

<p>We scrambled from this ravine, and galloping away through
the hollows, soon found another, winding like a snake among
the hills, and so deep that it completely concealed us. We rode
up the bottom of it, glancing through the shrubbery at its edge,
till Henry abruptly jerked his rein and slid out of his saddle.
Full a quarter of a mile distant, on the outline of the farthest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
hill, a long procession of buffalo were walking, in <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref8">Indian file</a>, with
the utmost gravity and deliberation; then more appeared, clambering
from a hollow not far off, and ascending, one behind the
other, the grassy slope of another hill; then a shaggy head and a
pair of short, broken horns appeared, issuing out of a ravine close
at hand, and with a slow, stately step, one by one, the enormous
brutes came into view, taking their way across the valley, wholly
unconscious of an enemy. In a moment Henry was <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref9">worming
his way</a>, lying flat on the ground, through grass and prickly-pears,
toward his unsuspecting victims. He had with him both my
rifle and his own. He was soon out of sight, and still the buffalo
kept issuing into the valley. For a long time all was silent; I
sat holding his horse, and wondering what he was about, when
suddenly, in rapid succession, came the sharp reports of the two
rifles, and the whole line of buffalo, quickening their pace into a
clumsy trot, gradually disappeared over the ridge of the hill.
Henry rose to his feet, and stood looking after them.</p>

<p>“You have missed them,” said I.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Henry; “let us go.” He descended into the ravine,
loaded the rifles, and mounted his horse.</p>

<p>We rode up the hill after the buffalo. The herd was out of
sight when we reached the top, but lying on the grass not far off
was one quite lifeless, and another violently struggling in the
death agony.</p>

<p>“You see I miss him!” remarked Henry. He had fired from
a distance of more than a hundred and fifty yards, and both balls
had passed through the lungs—the true mark in shooting buffalo.</p>

<p>The darkness increased, and a driving storm came on. Tying
our horses to the horns of the victims, Henry began the bloody
work of dissection, slashing away with the <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref10">science of a connoisseur</a>,
while I vainly endeavored to imitate him. Old Hendrick
recoiled with horror and indignation when I endeavored to tie
the meat to the strings of rawhide, always carried for this purpose,
dangling at the back of the saddle. After some difficulty
we <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref11">overcame his scruples</a>; and heavily burdened with the <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref12">more eligible
portions</a> of the buffalo, we set out on our return. Scarcely
had we emerged from the labyrinth of gorges and ravines, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
issued upon the open prairie, when the pricking sleet came driving,
gust upon gust, directly in our faces. It was strangely dark,
though wanting still an hour of sunset. The freezing storm soon
penetrated to the skin, but the uneasy trot of our heavy-gaited
horses kept us warm enough, as we forced them unwillingly <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref13">in
the teeth of the sleet</a> and rain by the powerful suasion of our
Indian whips. The prairie in this place was hard and level. A
flourishing colony of prairie dogs had burrowed into it in every
direction, and the little mounds of fresh earth around their holes
were about as numerous as the hills in a cornfield; but not a yelp
was to be heard; not the nose of a single citizen was visible; all
had retired to the depths of their burrows, and we envied them
their dry and comfortable habitations. An hour’s hard riding
showed us our tent dimly looming through the storm, one side
puffed out by the force of the wind, and the other <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref14">collapsed in
proportion</a>, while the disconsolate horses stood shivering close
around, and the wind kept up a dismal whistling in the boughs of
three old, half-dead trees above. Shaw, like a patriarch, sat on
his saddle in the entrance, with a pipe in his mouth and his arms
folded, contemplating with cool satisfaction the piles of meat that
we flung on the ground before him. A dark and dreary night succeeded;
but the sun rose with a heat so sultry and languid that
the captain excused himself on that account from waylaying an
old buffalo bull, who with stupid gravity was walking over the
prairie to drink at the river. So much for the climate of the
Platte!</p>

<h5>AN UNSUCCESSFUL HUNT</h5>

<p>But it was not the weather alone that had produced this sudden
abatement of the sportsmanlike zeal which the captain had
always professed. He had been out on the afternoon before,
together with several members of his party; but their hunting
was attended with no other result than the loss of one of their
best horses, severely injured by Sorel in vainly chasing a wounded
bull. The captain, whose ideas of hard riding were all derived
from <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref15">transatlantic sources</a>, expressed the utmost amazement at
the feats of Sorel, who went leaping ravines and dashing at full
speed up and down the sides of precipitous hills, lashing his horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
with the recklessness of a Rocky Mountain rider. Unfortunately
for the poor animal, he was the property of R., against whom
Sorel entertained <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref16">an unbounded aversion</a>. The captain himself,
it seemed, had also attempted <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref17">to “run” a buffalo</a>, but though a
good and practiced horseman, he had soon given over the attempt,
being astonished and utterly disgusted at the nature of the ground
he was required to ride over.</p>

<p>Nothing unusual occurred on that day; but on the following
morning Henry Chatillon, looking over the ocean-like expanse,
saw near the foot of the distant hills something that looked like
a band of buffalo. He was not sure, he said, but at all events, if
they were buffalo there was a fine chance for a race. Shaw and
I at once determined to try the speed of our horses.</p>

<p>“Come, captain; we’ll see which can ride hardest, a Yankee
or an Irishman.”</p>

<p>But the captain maintained a grave and austere countenance.
He mounted his led horse, however, though very slowly, and we
set out at a trot. The game appeared about three miles distant.
As we proceeded, the captain made various remarks of doubt and
indecision, and at length declared he would have nothing to do
with such a breakneck business; protesting that he had ridden
plenty of steeple-chases in his day, but he never knew what
riding was till he found himself behind a band of buffalo the day
before yesterday. “I am convinced,” said the captain, “that
‘running’ is out of the question. Take my advice now and don’t
attempt it. It’s dangerous, and of no use at all.”</p>

<p>“Then why did you come out with us? What do you mean
to do?”</p>

<p>“<a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref18">I shall ‘approach,’</a>” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to ‘approach’ with your pistols, do you?
We have all of us left our rifles in the wagons.”</p>

<p>The captain seemed <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref19">staggered at the suggestion</a>. In his <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref20">characteristic
indecision</a>, at setting out, pistols, rifles, “running,” and
“approaching” were mingled in an inextricable medley in his
brain. He trotted on in silence between us for a while; but at
length he dropped behind, and slowly walked his horse back to
rejoin the party. Shaw and I kept on; when lo! as we advanced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the band of buffalo were transformed into certain clumps of tall
bushes, dotting the prairie for a considerable distance. At this
ludicrous termination of our chase, we followed the example of
our late ally and turned back toward the party. We were skirting
the brink of a deep ravine, when we saw Henry and the broad-chested
pony coming toward us at a gallop.</p>

<p>“Here’s old Papin and Frederic, down from Fort Laramie!”
shouted Henry, long before he came up. We had for some days
expected this encounter. Papin was the <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref21"><i lang="fr">bourgeois</i> of Fort Laramie</a>.
He had come down the river with the buffalo robes and
the beaver, the produce of the last winter’s trading. I had among
our baggage a letter which I wished to commit to their hands;
so, requesting Henry to detain the boats if he could until my
return, I set out after the wagons. They were about four miles
in advance. In half an hour I overtook them, got the letter,
trotted back upon the trail, and looking carefully as I rode, saw
a patch of broken, storm-blasted trees, and moving near them
some little black specks like men and horses. Arriving at the
place, I found a strange assembly. The boats, eleven in number,
deep-laden with the skins, hugged close to the shore to escape
being borne down by the swift current. The rowers, swarthy,
ignoble Mexicans, turned their brutish faces upward to look as I
reached the bank. Papin sat in the middle of one of the boats
upon the canvas covering that protected the robes. He was a
stout, robust fellow, with a little gray eye that had a peculiarly
sly twinkle. “Frederic” also stretched his tall, <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref22">rawboned proportions</a>
close by the <i lang="fr">bourgeois</i>, and “mountain-men” completed the
group; some lounging in the boats, some strolling on shore; some
attired in gayly painted buffalo robes like Indian dandies; some
with hair saturated with red paint, and beplastered with glue to
their temples; and one bedaubed with vermilion upon his forehead
and each cheek. They were a mongrel race, yet the French
blood seemed to predominate; in a few, indeed, might be seen
the black, snaky eye of the Indian half-breed; and one and all,
they seemed to aim at <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref23">assimilating themselves</a> to their savage
associates.</p>

<p>I shook hands with the <i lang="fr">bourgeois</i> and delivered the letter;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
then the boats swung around into the stream and floated away.
They had reason for haste, for already the voyage from Fort
Laramie had occupied a full month, and the river was growing
daily more shallow. Fifty times a day the boats had been
aground; indeed, those who navigate the Platte invariably spend
half their time upon sand-bars. Two of these boats, the property
of private traders, afterward separating from the rest, got hopelessly
<a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref24">involved in the shallows</a>, not very far from the Pawnee
villages, and were soon surrounded by a swarm of the inhabitants.
They carried off everything that they considered valuable,
including most of the robes; and amused themselves by
tying up the men left on guard, and soundly whipping them with
sticks.</p>

<p>We encamped that night upon the bank of the river. Among
the emigrants there was an overgrown boy, some eighteen years
old, with a head as round and about as large as a pumpkin, and
fever-and-ague fits had dyed his face of a corresponding color.
He wore an old white hat, tied under his chin with a handkerchief;
his body was short and stout, but his legs of <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref25">disproportioned and
appalling</a> length. I observed him at sunset <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref26">breasting the hill</a>
with gigantic strides, and standing against the sky on the summit
like a colossal pair of tongs. In a moment after, we heard him
screaming frantically behind the ridge, and nothing doubting
that he was in the clutches of Indians or grizzly bears, some of
the party caught up their rifles and ran to the rescue. His outcries,
however, proved but an ebullition of joyous excitement;
he had chased two little wolf pups to their burrow, and he was on
his knees, grubbing away like a dog at the mouth of the hole,
to get at them.</p>

<p>Before morning he caused more serious disquiet in the camp.
It was his turn to <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref27">hold the middle guard</a>; but no sooner was he
called up than he coolly arranged a pair of saddle-bags under a
wagon, laid his head upon them, closed his eyes, opened his mouth,
and fell asleep. The guard on our side of the camp, thinking it
no part of his duty to look after the cattle of the emigrants, contented
himself with watching our own horses and mules; the
wolves, he said, were unusually noisy; but still no mischief was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
anticipated, until the sun rose, and not a hoof or horn was in
sight! The cattle were gone! While Tom was quietly slumbering,
the wolves had driven them away.</p>

<p>Then we <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref28">reaped the fruits</a> of R.’s <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref29">precious plan</a> of traveling
in company with emigrants. To leave them in their distress was
not to be thought of, and we felt bound to wait until the cattle
could be searched for, and, if possible, recovered. But the reader
may be curious to know what punishment awaited the faithless
Tom. By the <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref30">wholesome law of the prairie</a>, he who falls asleep
on guard is condemned to walk all day, leading his horse by the
bridle, and we found much fault with our companions for not
enforcing such a sentence on the offender. Nevertheless, had he
been of our own party, I have no doubt he would in like manner
have escaped scot-free. But the emigrants went further than
mere forbearance; they decreed that since Tom couldn’t stand
guard without falling asleep, he shouldn’t stand guard at all, and
henceforward his slumbers were unbroken. Establishing such a
premium on drowsiness could have no very beneficial effect upon
the vigilance of our sentinels; for it is far from agreeable, after
riding from sunrise to sunset, to feel your slumbers interrupted
by the butt of a rifle nudging your side, and a sleepy voice growling
in your ear that you must get up, to shiver and freeze for
three weary hours at midnight.</p>

<h5>LOST ON THE GREAT PLAINS</h5>

<p>“Buffalo! buffalo!” It was but a grim old bull, roaming the
prairie by himself in misanthropic seclusion; but there might be
more behind the hills. Dreading the monotony and languor of
the camp, Shaw and I saddled our horses, buckled our holsters
in their places, and set out with Henry Chatillon in search of the
game. Henry, not intending to take part in the chase, but merely
conducting us, carried his rifle with him, while we left ours behind
as incumbrances. We rode for some five or six miles, and saw no
living thing but wolves, snakes, and prairie dogs.</p>

<p>“This won’t do at all,” said Shaw.</p>

<p>“What won’t do?”</p>

<p>“There’s no wood about here to make a litter for the wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
man; I have an idea that one of us will need something of the
sort before the day is over.”</p>

<p>There was some foundation for <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref31">such an apprehension</a>, for the
ground was none of the best for a race, and grew worse continually
as we proceeded; indeed it soon became desperately bad,
consisting of abrupt hills and deep hollows, cut by frequent
ravines not easy to pass. At length, a mile in advance, we saw
a band of bulls. Some were scattered grazing over a green declivity,
while the rest were crowded more densely together in the
wide hollow below. Making a circuit to keep out of sight, we rode
toward them until we ascended a hill within a furlong of them,
beyond which nothing intervened that could possibly screen us
from their view. We dismounted behind the ridge just out of
sight, <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref32">drew our saddle-girths</a>, examined our pistols, and mounting
again rode over the hill and descended at a canter toward them,
bending close to our horses’ necks. Instantly they took the alarm;
those on the hill descended; those below gathered into a mass,
and the whole got in motion, shouldering each other along at a
clumsy gallop. We followed, spurring our horses to full speed;
and as the herd rushed, crowding and trampling in terror through
an opening in the hills, we were close at their heels, half suffocated
by the clouds of dust. But as we drew near, their alarm
and speed increased; our horses showed signs of the utmost fear,
bounding violently aside as we approached, and refusing to enter
among the herd. The buffalo now broke into several small bodies,
scampering over the hills in different directions, and I lost sight
of Shaw; neither of us knew where the other had gone. Old
Pontiac ran like a frantic elephant up hill and down hill, his
ponderous hoofs striking the prairie like sledge-hammers. He
showed a curious mixture of eagerness and terror, straining to
overtake the panic-stricken herd, but constantly recoiling in
dismay as we drew near. The fugitives, indeed, offered no very
attractive spectacle, with their enormous size and weight, their
shaggy manes and the tattered remnants of their last winter’s hair
covering their backs in irregular shreds and patches, and flying
off in the wind as they ran. At length I urged my horse close
behind a bull, and after trying in vain, by blows and spurring, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
bring him alongside, I shot a bullet into the buffalo from this
disadvantageous position. At the report, Pontiac swerved so
much that I was again thrown a little behind the game. The
bullet, entering too much in the rear, failed to disable the bull,
for a buffalo requires to be shot at particular points or he will
certainly escape. The herd ran up a hill, and I followed in pursuit.
As Pontiac rushed headlong down on the other side, I saw
Shaw and Henry descending the hollow on the right at a leisurely
gallop; and in front, the buffalo were just disappearing behind
the crest of the next hill, their short tails erect and their hoofs
twinkling through a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>At that moment I heard Shaw and Henry shouting to me; but
the muscles of a stronger arm than mine could not have checked
at once the furious course of Pontiac, whose mouth was as insensible
as leather. Added to this, I rode him that morning with a
common snaffle, having the day before, for the benefit of my other
horse, unbuckled from my bridle the curb which I ordinarily used.
A stronger and hardier brute never trod the prairie; but the novel
sight of the buffalo filled him with terror, and when at full speed
he was almost incontrollable. Gaining the top of the ridge, I saw
nothing of the buffalo; they had all vanished amid the intricacies
of the hills and hollows. Reloading my pistols in the best way
I could, I galloped on until I saw them again scuttling along at
the base of the hill, their panic somewhat abated. Down went
old Pontiac among them, scattering them to the right and left,
and then we had another long chase. About a dozen bulls were
before us, scouring over the hills, rushing down the declivities
with tremendous weight and impetuosity, and then <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref33">laboring with
a weary gallop</a> upward. Still Pontiac, in spite of spurring and
beating, would not close with them. One bull at length fell a
little behind the rest, and by <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref34">dint of much effort</a> I urged my horse
within six or eight yards of his side. His back was darkened
with sweat, and he was panting heavily, while his tongue lolled
out a foot from his jaws. Gradually I came up abreast of him,
urging Pontiac with leg and rein nearer to his side, when suddenly
he did what buffalo in such circumstances will always do:
he slackened his gallop, and turning toward us with an aspect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
mingled rage and distress, lowered his huge shaggy head for a
charge. Pontiac, with a snort, leaped aside in terror, nearly
throwing me to the ground, as I was wholly unprepared for such
an evolution. I raised my pistol in a passion to strike him on the
head, but thinking better of it, fired the bullet after the bull, who
had resumed his flight; then drew rein, and determined to rejoin
my companions. It was <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref35">high time</a>. The breath blew hard from
Pontiac’s nostrils, and the sweat rolled in big drops down his
sides; I myself felt as if drenched in warm water. Pledging
myself (and I redeemed the pledge) to take my revenge at a
future opportunity, I looked round for some indications to show
me where I was, and what course I ought to pursue. I might as
well have looked for landmarks in the midst of the ocean. How
many miles I had run or in what direction, I had no idea; and
around me the prairie was rolling in steep swells and pitches,
without a single distinctive feature to guide me. I had a little
compass hung at my neck; and ignorant that the Platte at this
point diverged considerably from its easterly course, I thought
that by keeping to the northward I should certainly reach it. So
I turned and rode about two hours in that direction. The prairie
changed as I advanced, softening away into easier undulations,
but nothing like the Platte appeared, nor any sign of a human
being; the same wild endless expanse lay around me still; and to
all appearance I was as far from my object as ever. I began
now to consider myself in danger of being lost; and therefore,
reining in my horse, summoned the scanty share of woodcraft that
I possessed (if that term be applicable upon the prairie) to extricate
me. Looking round, it occurred to me that the buffalo
might prove my best guides. I soon found one of the paths made
by them in their passage to the river; it ran nearly at right angles
to my course; but turning my horse’s head in the direction it
indicated, his freer gait and erected ears assured me that I was
right.</p>

<p>But in the meantime my ride had been by no means a solitary
one. The whole face of the country was dotted far and wide
with countless hundreds of buffalo. They trooped along in files
and columns, bulls, cows, and calves, on the green faces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
declivities in front. They scrambled away over the hills to the
right and left; and far off, the pale blue swells in the extreme distance
were dotted with innumerable specks. Sometimes I surprised
shaggy old bulls grazing alone, or sleeping behind the
ridges I ascended. They would leap up at my approach, stare
stupidly at me through their tangled manes, and then gallop
heavily away. The antelope were very numerous; and as they
are always bold when in the neighborhood of buffalo, they would
approach quite near to look at me, gazing intently with their
great round eyes, then suddenly leap aside and stretch lightly
away over the prairie as swiftly as a racehorse. Squalid, ruffian-like
wolves sneaked through the hollows and sandy ravines. Several
times I passed through villages of prairie dogs, who sat, each
at the mouth of his burrow, holding his paws before him in a
<a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref36">supplicating attitude</a> and yelping away most vehemently, energetically
whisking his little tail with every squeaking cry he
uttered. Prairie dogs are not fastidious in their choice of companions;
various long, checkered snakes were sunning themselves
in the midst of the village, and demure little gray owls, with a
large white ring around each eye, were perched side by side with
the <a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref37">rightful inhabitants</a>. The prairie teemed with life. Again
and again I looked toward the crowded hillsides, and was sure I
saw horsemen; and riding near, with a mixture of hope and dread,
for Indians were abroad, I found them transformed into a group
of buffalo. There was nothing in human shape amid all this
<a href="#phrases1" title="List of phrases" id="ref38">vast congregation</a> of brute forms.</p>

<p>When I turned down the buffalo path, the prairie seemed
changed; only a wolf or two glided past at intervals, like conscious
felons, never looking to the right or left. Being now free
from anxiety, I was at leisure to observe minutely the objects
around me; and here, for the first time, I noticed insects wholly
different from any of the varieties found farther to the eastward.
Gaudy butterflies fluttered about my horse’s head; strangely
formed beetles, glittering with metallic luster, were crawling upon
plants that I had never seen before; multitudes of lizards, too,
were darting like lightning over the sand.</p>

<p>I had run to a great distance from the river. It cost me a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ride on the buffalo path before I saw from the ridge of a sand-hill
the pale surface of the Platte glistening in the midst of its desert
valleys, and the faint outline of the hills beyond waving along the
sky. From where I stood, not a tree nor a bush nor a living thing
was visible throughout the whole extent of the sun-scorched landscape.
In half an hour I came upon the trail, not far from the
river; and seeing that the party had not yet passed, I turned eastward
to meet them, old Pontiac’s long, swinging trot again assuring
me that I was right in doing so. Having been slightly ill on
leaving camp in the morning, six or seven hours of rough riding
had fatigued me extremely. I soon stopped, therefore; flung my
saddle on the ground, and with my head resting on it, and my
horse’s trail-rope tied loosely to my arm, lay waiting the arrival
of the party, speculating meanwhile on the extent of the injuries
Pontiac had received. At length the white wagon coverings rose
from the verge of the plain. By a singular coincidence, almost
at the same moment two horsemen appeared coming down from
the hills. They were Shaw and Henry, who had searched for me
a while in the morning, but well knowing the futility of the attempt
in such a broken country, had placed themselves on the top of
the highest hill they could find, and picketing their horses near
them, as a signal to me, had lain down and fallen asleep.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biographical and Historical Note.</b> Francis Parkman (1823-1893) was
an American writer, born in Boston, where his father was a well-known
clergyman. At the age of eight years he went to live with his grandfather
on a wild tract of land near Boston, and there developed the fondness for
outdoor life which is shown in all his writings. Parkman was graduated from
Harvard College in 1844, and from the Harvard Law School two years later,
but he never practiced law. The journey related in his book, <cite>The Oregon
Trail</cite>, from which “The Buffalo” is taken, was made immediately after
Parkman completed his law studies. His purpose was to gain an intimate
knowledge of Indian life. From the Missouri River two great overland
routes led across the country to the Pacific. One, the Santa Fe trail, carried
a large overland trade with northern Mexico and southern California;
the other, the Oregon trail, was commonly used by emigrants on their way
to the northwest coast. Parkman’s journey occupied about five months.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
He left Boston in April, 1846, accompanied by Quincy Adams Shaw, a
relative, and went first to St. Louis, the trip by railroad, steamboat, and
stage requiring about two weeks. Here they engaged two guides and procured
an outfit, including a supply of presents for the Indians. After eight
days on a river steamboat they arrived at Independence, Missouri, where
the land journey began.</p>

<p>In a newspaper item of March tenth, 1919, the following appeared:
“For the first time in half a century bisons are on sale in Omaha. A herd of
thirty-three, raised on a Colorado ranch, arrived at the stock yards yesterday.
The meat will sell for around $1.00 a pound.”</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Locate on a map the Platte River and the region mentioned
in the story. 2. What picture do you see as you read the fourth paragraph?
3. Briefly relate the incident of the first afternoon’s hunting trip.
4. What objections to traveling with emigrants did the party find? 5. What
do you learn of prairie animals from this story? 6. Read the description
of the prairie dog found on page 12; why is this description a good one?
7. What insects that differ from those found farther east does the author
mention? 8. Point out lines that show Parkman to be excellent in description.
9. Compare travel at the time the author made this trip with travel at
the present time. 10. Pronounce the following: alternately; minute;
reptile; patriarch; inextricably; ally; robust; squalid; pumpkin; lolled;
applicable; vehemently; buttes; gorges; circuit.</p>

<h4>OLD EPHRAIM, THE GRIZZLY BEAR</h4>

<p class="author">THEODORE ROOSEVELT</p>

<h5>VARIETIES OF BEAR</h5>

<p>The king of the game beasts of temperate North America,
because the most dangerous to the hunter, is the grizzly bear;
known to the few remaining old-time trappers of the Rockies and
the Great Plains, sometimes as “Old Ephraim” and sometimes
as “Moccasin Joe”—the last in allusion to his queer, half-human
footprints, which look as if made by some misshapen giant,
walking in moccasins.</p>

<p>Bear vary greatly in size and color, no less than in temper
and habits. Old hunters speak much of them in their endless
talks over the camp-fires and in the snow-bound winter huts.
They insist on many species; not merely the black and the grizzly,
but the brown, the cinnamon, the gray, the silver-tip, and others
with names known only in certain localities, such as the range
bear, the roach-back, and the smut-face. But, in spite of <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref39">popular
opinion</a> to the contrary, most old hunters are very untrustworthy
in dealing with points of <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref40">natural history</a>. They usually know
only so much about any given game animal as will enable them
to kill it. They study its habits solely with this end in view;
and once slain they only examine it to see about its condition and
fur. With rare exceptions they are quite incapable of passing
judgment upon questions of <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref41">specific identity</a> or difference. When
questioned, they not only advance perfectly impossible theories
and facts in support of their views, but they rarely even agree as
to the views themselves. One hunter will assert that the true
grizzly is only found in California, heedless of the fact that the
name was first used by Lewis and Clark as one of the titles they
applied to the large bears of the plains country round the Upper
Missouri, a quarter of a century before the California grizzly was
known to fame. Another hunter will call any big brindled bear
a grizzly no matter where it is found; and he and his companions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
will dispute by the hour as to whether a bear of large, but not
extreme, size is a grizzly or a silver-tip. In Oregon the cinnamon
bear is a phase of the small black bear; in Montana it is the
plains variety of the large mountain silver-tip. I have myself
seen the skins of two bears killed on the upper waters of Tongue
River; one was that of a male, one of a female, and they had
evidently just mated; yet one was distinctly a “silver-tip” and
the other a “cinnamon.” The skin of one very big bear which I
killed in the Bighorn has proved a <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref42">standing puzzle</a> to almost all
the old hunters to whom I have shown it; rarely do any two of
them agree as to whether it is a grizzly, a silver-tip, a cinnamon,
or a “smut-face.” Any bear with unusually long hair on the
spine and shoulders, especially if killed in the spring, when the
fur is shaggy, is forthwith dubbed a “roach-back.” The average
sporting writer, moreover, joins with the more imaginative members
of the “old hunter” variety in ascribing wildly various traits
to these different bears. One comments on the <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref43">superior prowess</a>
of the roach-back; the explanation being that a bear in early
spring is apt to be ravenous from hunger. The next insists that
the California grizzly is the only really dangerous bear; while
another <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref44">stoutly maintains</a> that it does not compare in ferocity
with what he calls the “smaller” silver-tip or cinnamon. And
so on, and so on, without end. All of which is mere nonsense.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is no easy task to determine how many species
or varieties of bear actually do exist in the United States, and I
cannot even say without doubt that a very large set of skins and
skulls would not show a nearly complete intergradation between
the most <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref45">widely separated individuals</a>. However, there are certainly
two very distinct types, which differ almost as widely from
each other as a wapiti does from a mule deer, and which exist in
the same localities in most heavily timbered portions of the
Rockies. One is the small black bear, a bear which will average
about two hundred pounds weight, with fine, glossy, black fur,
and the foreclaws but little longer than the hinder ones; in fact,
the hairs of the forepaw often reach to their tips. This bear is a
tree climber. It is the only kind found east of the great plains,
and it is also plentiful in the forest-clad portions of the Rockies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
being common in most heavily timbered tracts throughout the
United States. The other is the grizzly, which weighs three or
four times as much as the black, and has a pelt of coarse hair,
which is in color gray, grizzled, or brown of various shades. It
is not a tree climber, and the foreclaws are very long, much longer
than the hinder ones. It is found from the great plains west of
the Mississippi to the Pacific coast. This bear <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref46">inhabits indifferently</a>
lowland and mountain; the deep woods and the barren
plains where the only cover is the stunted growth fringing the
streams. These two types are very distinct in every way, and
their differences are not at all dependent upon mere geographical
considerations; for they are often found in the same district.
Thus I found them both in the Bighorn Mountains, each type
being <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref47">in extreme form</a>, while the specimens I shot showed no
trace of intergradation. The huge, grizzled, long-clawed beast,
and its little, glossy-coated, short-clawed, tree-climbing brother
roamed over exactly the same country in those mountains; but
they were as distinct in habits, and mixed as little together as
moose and caribou.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when a sufficient number of bears from
widely separated regions are examined, the various distinguishing
marks are found to be inconstant and to show a tendency—exactly
how strong I cannot say—to fade into one another. The
differentiation of the two species seems to be as yet scarcely completed;
there are more or less <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref48">imperfect connecting links</a>, and as
regards the grizzly it almost seems as if the specific characters were
still unstable. In the far Northwest, in the basin of the Columbia,
the “black” bear is as often brown as any other color; and I have
seen the skins of two cubs, one black and one brown, which were
shot when following the same dam. When these brown bears
have coarser hair than usual their skins are with difficulty to be
distinguished from those of certain varieties of the grizzly. Moreover,
all bears vary greatly in size; and I have seen the bodies
of very large black or brown bears with short foreclaws which
were fully as heavy as, or perhaps heavier than, some small but
full-grown grizzlies with long foreclaws. These very large bears
with short claws are very reluctant to climb a tree; and are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
almost as clumsy about it as is a young grizzly. Among the grizzlies
the fur varies much in color and texture even among bears of
the same locality; it is of course richest in the deep forest, while
the bears of the dry plains and mountains are of a lighter, more
washed-out hue.</p>

<p>A full-grown grizzly will usually weigh from five to seven hundred
pounds; but exceptional individuals undoubtedly reach more
than twelve hundredweight. The California bears are said to be
much the largest. This I think is so, but I cannot say it with
certainty—at any rate, I have examined several skins of full-grown
Californian bears which were no larger than those of many
I have seen from the northern Rockies. The Alaskan bears, particularly
those of the peninsula, are even bigger beasts; the skin
of one which I saw in the possession of Mr. Webster, the taxidermist,
was a good deal larger than the average polar bear skin;
and the animal when alive, if in good condition, could hardly
have weighed less than 1400 pounds. Bears vary wonderfully
in weight, even to the extent of becoming half as heavy again,
according as they are fat or lean; in this respect they are more
like hogs than like any other animals.</p>

<h5>HABITS OF BEAR</h5>

<p>The grizzly is now chiefly a beast of the high hills and heavy
timber; but this is merely because he has learned that he must
<a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref49">rely on cover</a> to guard him from man, and has forsaken the open
ground accordingly. In old days, and in one or two very out-of-the-way
places almost to the present time, he wandered at will
over the plains. It is only the <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref50">wariness born of fear</a> which nowadays
causes him to cling to the thick brush of the large river
bottoms throughout the plains country. When there were no
rifle-bearing hunters in the land, to harass him and make him
afraid, he roved hither and thither at will, in burly self-confidence.
Then he cared little for cover, unless as a weather-break,
or because it happened to contain food he liked. If the humor
seized him he would roam for days over the rolling or broken
prairie, searching for roots, digging up gophers, or perhaps following
the great buffalo herds either to prey on some unwary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
straggler which he was able to catch at a disadvantage in a washout,
or else to feast on the carcasses of those which died by accident.
Old hunters, survivors of the long-vanished ages when
the vast herds thronged the high plains and were followed by
the wild red tribes, and by bands of whites who were scarcely
less savage, have told me that they often met bears under such
circumstances; and these bears were accustomed to sleep in a
patch of rank sage bush, in the niche of a washout, or under the
<a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref51">lee of a bowlder</a>, seeking their food abroad even in full daylight.
The bears of the Upper Missouri basin—which were so light in
color that the early explorers often alluded to them as gray or
even as “white”—were particularly given to this life in the open.
To this day that close kinsman of the grizzly known as the bear
of the barren grounds continues to lead this same kind of life, in
the far north. My friend, Mr. Rockhill, of Maryland, who was
the first white man to explore eastern Tibet, describes the large
grizzly-like bear of those desolate uplands as having similar habits.</p>

<p>However, the grizzly is a shrewd beast and shows the usual
bear-like capacity for adapting himself to changed conditions.
He has in most places become a cover-haunting animal, sly in his
ways, <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref52">wary to a degree</a>, and clinging to the shelter of the deepest
forests in the mountains and of the most tangled thickets in the
plains. Hence he has <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref53">held his own</a> far better than such game as
the bison and elk. He is much less common than formerly, but
he is still to be found throughout most of his former range; save,
of course, in the immediate neighborhood of the large towns.</p>

<p>In most places the grizzly hibernates, or, as old hunters say,
“holes up,” during the cold season, precisely as does the black
bear; but, as with the latter species, those animals which live
farthest south spend the whole year abroad in mild seasons. The
grizzly rarely chooses that favorite den of his little black brother,
a hollow tree or log, for his winter sleep, seeking or making some
cavernous hole in the ground instead. The hole is sometimes in
a slight hillock in a river bottom, but more often on a hill-side,
and may be either shallow or deep. In the mountains it is generally
a natural cave in the rock, but among the foot-hills and on
the plains the bear usually has to take some hollow or opening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and then fashion it into a burrow to his liking with his big digging
claws.</p>

<p>Before the cold weather sets in, the bear begins to grow restless,
and to roam about seeking for a good place in which to hole
up. One will often try and abandon several caves or partially
dug-out burrows in succession before finding a place to its taste.
It always endeavors to choose a spot where there is little chance
of discovery or molestation, taking great care to avoid leaving
too evident trace of its work. Hence it is not often that the
dens are found.</p>

<p>Once in its den the bear passes the cold months in lethargic
sleep; yet, in all but the coldest weather, and sometimes even
then, its slumber is but light, and if disturbed it will promptly
leave its den, prepared for fight or flight as the occasion may
require. Many times when a hunter has stumbled on the winter
resting-place of a bear and has left it, as he thought, without his
presence being discovered, he has returned only to find that the
crafty old fellow was aware of the danger all the time, and
sneaked off as soon as the coast was clear. But in very cold
weather hibernating bears can hardly be wakened from their
torpid lethargy.</p>

<p>The length of time a bear stays in its den depends of course
upon the severity of the season and the latitude and altitude of
the country.</p>

<p>When the bear first leaves its den the fur is in very fine order,
but it speedily becomes thin and poor, and does not recover its
condition until the fall. Sometimes the bear does not betray any
great hunger for a few days after its appearance; but in a short
while it becomes ravenous. During the early spring, when the
woods are still entirely barren and lifeless, while the snow yet
lies in deep drifts, the lean, hungry brute, both maddened and
weakened by long fasting, is more of a flesh eater than at any
other time. It is at this period that it is most apt to turn true
beast of prey, and show its prowess either at the expense of the
wild game, or of the flocks of the settler and the herds of the
ranchman. Bears are very capricious in this respect, however.
Some are confirmed game and cattle killers; others are not; while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
yet others either are or are not, accordingly as the freak seizes
them, and their ravages vary almost unaccountably, both with
the season and the locality.</p>

<h5>AN EXCITING BEAR HUNT</h5>

<p>I spent much of the fall of 1889 hunting on the head-waters
of the Salmon and Snake in Idaho, and along the Montana boundary
line from the Big Hole Basin and the head of the Wisdom
River to the neighborhood of Red Rock Pass and to the north
and west of Henry’s Lake. During the last fortnight my companion
was the old mountain man named Griffeth or Griffin—I
cannot tell which, as he was always called either “Hank” or
“Griff.” He was a <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref54">crabbedly honest</a> old fellow, and a very skillful
hunter; but he was worn out with age and rheumatism, and his
temper had failed even faster than his bodily strength. He
showed me a greater variety of game than I had ever seen before
in so short a time; nor did I ever before or after make so successful
a hunt. But he was an exceedingly disagreeable companion
on account of his surly, moody ways. I generally had to get up
first, to kindle the fire and make ready breakfast, and he was
very quarrelsome. Finally, during my absence from camp one
day, while not very far from Red Rock Pass, he found my
whiskey-flask, which I kept purely for emergencies, and drank all
the contents. When I came back he was quite drunk. This was
unbearable, and after some high words I left him, and struck off
homeward through the woods on my own account. We had with
us four pack and saddle horses; and of these I took a very intelligent
and gentle little bronco mare, which possessed the invaluable
trait of always staying near camp, even when not hobbled. I
was not hampered with much of an outfit, having only my buffalo
sleeping-bag, a fur coat, and my washing-kit, with a couple of
spare pairs of socks and some handkerchiefs. A frying-pan,
some salt, flour, baking-powder, a small chunk of salt pork, and
a hatchet made up a light pack, which, with the bedding, I fastened
across the stock saddle by means of a rope and a spare
packing cinch. My cartridges and knife were in my belt; my
compass and matches, as always, in my pocket. I walked, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the little mare followed almost like a dog, often without my
having to hold the lariat which served as halter.</p>

<p>The country was for the most part fairly open, as I kept near
the foot-hills where glades and little prairies broke the pine forest.
The trees were of small size. There was no regular trail, but the
course was easy to keep, and I had no trouble of any kind save
on the second day. That afternoon I was following a stream
which at last “canyoned up”—that is, sank to the bottom of a
canyon-like ravine impassable for a horse. I started up a side
valley, intending to cross from its head coulies to those of another
valley which would lead in below the canyon.</p>

<p>However, I got enmeshed in the tangle of winding valleys at
the foot of the steep mountains, and as dusk was coming on I
halted and camped in a little open spot by the side of a small,
noisy brook, with crystal water. The place was carpeted with
soft, wet, green moss, dotted red with the kinnikinnic berries,
and at its edge, under the trees where the ground was dry, I threw
down the buffalo bed on the mat of sweet-smelling pine needles.
Making camp took but a moment. I opened the pack, tossed the
bedding on a smooth spot, knee-haltered the little mare, dragged
up a few dry logs, and then strolled off, rifle on shoulder, through
the frosty gloaming, to see if I could pick up a grouse for supper.</p>

<p>For half a mile I walked quickly and silently over the pine
needles, across a succession of slight ridges separated by narrow,
shallow valleys. The forest here was composed of lodge-pole
pines, which on the ridges grew close together, with tall slender
trunks, while in the valleys the growth was more open. Though
the sun was behind the mountains there was yet plenty of light
by which to shoot, but it was fading rapidly.</p>

<p>At last, as I was thinking of turning toward camp, I stole up
to the crest of one of the ridges, and looked over into the valley
some sixty yards off. Immediately I caught the loom of some
large, dark object; and another glance showed me a big grizzly
walking slowly off with his head down. He was <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref55">quartering to
me</a>, and I fired into his flank, the bullet, as I afterward found,
ranging forward and piercing one lung. At the shot he uttered a
loud, moaning grunt and plunged forward at a heavy gallop, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
I raced obliquely down the hill to cut him off. After going a few
hundred feet he reached a laurel thicket, some thirty yards broad,
and two or three times as long, which he did not leave. I ran up
to the edge and there halted, not liking to venture into the mass
of twisted, close-growing stems and glossy foliage. Moreover, as
I halted, I heard him utter a peculiar, savage kind of whine from
the heart of the brush. Accordingly, I began to skirt the edge,
standing on tiptoe and gazing earnestly to see if I could not catch
a glimpse of his hide. When I was at the narrowest part of the
thicket, he suddenly left it directly opposite, and then wheeled
and stood broadside to me on the hill-side, a little above. He
turned his head stiffly toward me; scarlet strings of froth hung
from his lips; his eyes burned like embers in the gloom.</p>

<p>I held true, aiming behind the shoulder, and my bullet shattered
the point or lower end of his heart, taking out a big nick.
Instantly the great bear turned with a harsh roar of fury and
challenge, blowing the bloody foam from his mouth, so that I saw
the gleam of his white fangs; and then he charged straight at me,
crashing and bounding through the laurel bushes, so that it was
hard to aim. I waited until he came to a fallen tree, raking him
as he topped it with a ball which entered his chest and went
through the cavity of his body, but he neither swerved nor
flinched, and at the moment I did not know that I had struck him.
He came steadily on, and in another second was almost upon
me. I fired for his forehead, but my bullet went low, entering his
open mouth, smashing his lower jaw and going into the neck. I
leaped to one side almost as I pulled trigger; and through the
hanging smoke the first thing I saw was his paw as he made a
vicious side blow at me. The rush of his charge carried him
past. As he struck he lurched forward, leaving a pool of bright
blood where his muzzle hit the ground; but he recovered himself
and made two or three jumps onward, while I hurriedly jammed
a couple of cartridges into the magazine, my rifle holding only
four, all of which I had fired. Then he tried to pull up, but as
he did so his muscles seemed suddenly to give way, his head
drooped, and he rolled over and over like a shot rabbit. Each
of my first three bullets had inflicted a mortal wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>It was already twilight, and I merely opened the carcass, and
then trotted back to camp. Next morning I returned and with
much labor took off the skin. The fur was very fine, the animal
being in excellent trim, and unusually bright-colored. Unfortunately,
in packing it out I lost the skull, and had to supply its
place with one of plaster. The beauty of the trophy, and the
memory of the circumstances under which I procured it, make
me value it perhaps more highly than any other in my house.</p>

<p>This is the only instance in which I have been regularly
charged by a grizzly. On the whole, the danger of hunting these
great bears has been much exaggerated. At the beginning of the
present century, when white hunters first encountered the grizzly,
he was doubtless an exceedingly savage beast, prone to attack
without provocation, and a redoubtable foe to persons armed
with the clumsy, small-bore, muzzle-loading rifles of the day.
But at present, bitter experience has taught him caution. He has
been hunted for sport, and hunted for his pelt, and <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref56">hunted for
the bounty</a>, and hunted as a dangerous enemy to stock, until, save
in the very wildest districts, he has learned to be more wary than
a deer, and to avoid man’s presence almost as carefully as the
most timid kind of game. Except in rare cases he will not attack
of his own accord, and, as a rule, even when wounded his object
is escape rather than battle.</p>

<p>Still, when fairly <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref57">brought to bay</a>, or when moved by a sudden
fit of ungovernable anger, the grizzly is <a href="#phrases2" title="List of phrases" id="ref58">beyond peradventure</a> a
very dangerous antagonist. The first shot, if taken at a bear a
good distance off and previously unwounded and unharried, is not
usually fraught with much danger, the startled animal being at
the outset bent merely on flight. It is always hazardous, however,
to track a wounded and worried grizzly into thick cover,
and the man who habitually follows and kills this chief of American
game in dense timber, never abandoning the bloody trail
whithersoever it leads, must show no small degree of skill and
hardihood, and must not too closely count the risk to life or limb.
Bears differ widely in temper, and occasionally one may be found
who will not show fight, no matter how much he is bullied; but,
as a rule, a hunter must be cautious in meddling with a wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
animal which has retreated into a dense thicket, and has been
once or twice roused; and such a beast, when it does turn, will
usually charge again and again, and fight to the last with unconquerable
ferocity. The short distance at which the bear can
be seen through the underbrush, the fury of its charge, and its
tenacity of life make it necessary for the hunter on such occasions
to have steady nerves and a fairly quick and accurate aim.
It is always well to have two men in following a wounded bear
under such conditions. This is not necessary, however, and a
good hunter, rather than lose his quarry, will, under ordinary circumstances,
follow and attack it, no matter how tangled the fastness
in which it has sought refuge; but he must act warily and
with the utmost caution and resolution, if he wishes to escape a
terrible and probably fatal mauling. An experienced hunter is
rarely rash, and never heedless; he will not, when alone, follow
a wounded bear into a thicket, if by the exercise of patience, skill,
and knowledge of the game’s habits he can avoid the necessity;
but it is idle to talk of the feat as something which ought in no
case to be attempted. While danger ought never to be needlessly
incurred, it is yet true that the keenest zest in sport comes from
its presence, and from the consequent exercise of the qualities
necessary to overcome it. The most thrilling moments of an
American hunter’s life are those in which, with every sense on
the alert, and with nerves strung to the highest point, he is following
alone into the heart of its forest fastness the fresh and
bloody footprints of an angered grizzly; and no other triumph of
American hunting can compare with the victory to be thus gained.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), twenty-sixth President
of the United States, was born in New York City. As a boy he was of
frail physique, but overcame this handicap by systematic exercise and outdoor
life. He was always interested in natural history, and at the age of
fourteen, when he accompanied his father on a tour up the Nile, he made
a collection of the Egyptian birds to be found in the Nile valley. This
collection is now in the Smithsonian Museum, Washington, D. C. In 1884,
Roosevelt bought two cattle ranches near Medora, in North Dakota,
where for two years he lived and entered actively into western life and spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1909, at the close of his presidency, he conducted an expedition to
Africa, to make a collection of tropical animals and plants. Expert naturalists
accompanied the party, which remained in the wilderness for a year,
and returned with a collection which scientists pronounce of unusual value
for students of natural history. Most of the specimens are now in the
Smithsonian Museum. Some of the books in which he has recorded his
hunting experiences are: <cite>African Game Trails</cite>, <cite>The Deer Family</cite>, and <cite>The
Wilderness Hunter</cite>, from which “Old Ephraim, the Grizzly Bear” is taken.</p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt’s last work as an explorer was his journey to South
America. On this journey he penetrated wildernesses rarely explored by
white men, and made many discoveries in the field of South American
animal and vegetable life and in geography.</p>

<p>The vigorous personality of this great American found expression not
only in the life of men and their political and social relations, but also in his
love of the great outdoors and the unbeaten tracks where life is an
adventure, primitive in surroundings, such a life as was lived by Sir Walter
Raleigh and other great seamen and explorers who were not content with
the tameness of the commonplace.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. By what characteristics may the grizzly generally be distinguished
from the black bear? 2. Which of these characteristics is most
fixed? 3. What change has taken place in the habits of the North American
grizzly? 4. Account for this change. 5. Locate the region in which
the author was hunting at the time of the adventure he narrates. 6. Describe
his outfit and tell what must be considered in providing such a

most exciting and dangerous? 8. What qualities must a hunter of such
game possess? 9. What conclusions does the author give as a result of his
experience in hunting “this chief of American game”? 10. What impression
of the author do you gain from this story? 11. Pronounce: species;

<h4>MOTI GUJ—MUTINEER</h4>

<p class="author">RUDYARD KIPLING</p>

<h5>DEESA’S PLAN FOR A VACATION</h5>

<p>Once upon a time there was a coffee-planter in India who
wished to clear some forest land for coffee-planting. When he
had cut down all the trees and burned the underwood, the stumps
still remained. Dynamite is expensive and slow fire slow. The
<a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref59">happy medium</a> for stump-clearing is the lord of all beasts, who is
the elephant. He will either push the stump out of the ground
with his tusks, if he has any, or drag it out with ropes. The
planter, therefore, hired elephants by ones and twos and threes,
and fell to work. The very best of all the elephants belonged to
the very worst of all the drivers or mahouts; and this superior
beast’s name was Moti Guj. He was the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref60">absolute property</a> of his
mahout, which would never have been <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref61">the case under native rule</a>:
for Moti Guj was a creature to be desired by kings, and his name,
being translated, meant the Pearl Elephant. Because the British
government was in the land, Deesa, the mahout, enjoyed his
property undisturbed. He was dissipated. When he had made
much money through the strength of his elephant, he would get
extremely drunk and give Moti Guj a beating with a tent-peg
over the tender nails of the forefeet. Moti Guj never trampled
the life out of Deesa on these occasions, for he knew that after
the beating was over, Deesa would embrace his trunk and weep
and call him his love and his life and the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref62">liver of his soul</a>, and
give him some liquor. Moti Guj was very fond of liquor—arrack
for choice, though he would drink palm-tree toddy if nothing
better offered. Then Deesa would go to sleep between Moti Guj’s
forefeet, and as Deesa generally chose the middle of the public
road, and as Moti Guj mounted guard over him, and would not
permit horse, foot, or cart to pass by, traffic was congested till
Deesa saw fit to wake up.</p>

<p>There was no sleeping in the daytime on the planter’s clearing:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the wages were too high to risk. Deesa sat on Moti Guj’s
neck and gave him orders, while Moti Guj rooted up the stumps—for
he owned a magnificent pair of tusks; or pulled at the end
of a rope—for he had a magnificent pair of shoulders—while
Deesa kicked him behind the ears and said he was the king of
elephants. At evening time Moti Guj would wash down his three
hundred pounds’ weight of green food with a quart of arrack,
and Deesa would take a share, and sing songs between Moti
Guj’s legs till it was time to go to bed. Once a week Deesa led
Moti Guj down to the river, and Moti Guj lay on his side luxuriously
in the shallows, while Deesa went over him with a coir-swab
and a brick. Moti Guj never mistook the pounding blow of
the latter for the smack of the former that warned him to get up
and turn over on the other side. Then Deesa would look at his
feet and examine his eyes, and turn up the fringes of his mighty
ears in case of sores or budding ophthalmia. After inspection the
two would “come up with a song from the sea,” Moti Guj, all
black and shining, weaving a torn tree branch twelve feet long in
his trunk, and Deesa knotting up his own long wet hair.</p>

<p>It was a peaceful, well-paid life till Deesa felt the return of
the desire to drink deep. He wished for an orgy. The little
<a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref63">draughts that led nowhere</a> were taking the manhood out of him.</p>

<p>He went to the planter, and “My mother’s dead,” said he,
weeping.</p>

<p>“She died on the last plantation two months ago, and she died
once before that when you were working for me last year,” said
the planter, who knew something of the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref64">ways of nativedom</a>.</p>

<p>“Then it’s my aunt, and she was just the same as a mother to
me,” said Deesa, weeping more than ever. “She has left eighteen
small children entirely without bread, and it is I who must fill
their little stomachs,” said Deesa, beating his head on the floor.</p>

<p>“Who brought you the news?” said the planter.</p>

<p>“The post,” said Deesa.</p>

<p>“There hasn’t been a post here for the past week. Get back to
your lines!”</p>

<p>“A devastating sickness has fallen on my village, and all my
wives are dying,” yelled Deesa, really in tears this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“Call Chihun, who comes from Deesa’s village,” said the
planter. “Chihun, has this man got a wife?”</p>

<p>“He?” said Chihun. “No. Not a woman of our village would
look at him. They’d sooner marry the elephant.”</p>

<p>Chihun snorted. Deesa wept and bellowed.</p>

<p>“You will get into a difficulty in a minute,” said the planter.
“Go back to your work!”</p>

<p>“Now I will speak Heaven’s truth,” gulped Deesa, <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref65">with an
inspiration</a>. “I haven’t been drunk for two months. I desire to
depart in order to get properly drunk afar off and distant from
this heavenly plantation. Thus I shall cause no trouble.”</p>

<p>A flickering smile crossed the planter’s face. “Deesa,” said
he, “you’ve spoken the truth, and I’d give you leave on the spot
if anything could be done with Moti Guj while you’re away. You
know that he will only obey your orders.”</p>

<p>“May the light of the heavens live forty thousand years. I
shall be absent but ten little days. After that, upon my faith
and honor and soul, I return. As to the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref66">inconsiderable interval</a>,
have I the gracious permission of the heaven-born to call up
Moti Guj?”</p>

<p>Permission was granted, and in answer to Deesa’s shrill yell,
the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref67">mighty tusker</a> swung out of the shade of a clump of trees
where he had been squirting dust over himself till his master
should return.</p>

<p>“Light of my heart, protector of the drunken, mountain of
might, give ear!” said Deesa, standing in front of him.</p>

<p>Moti Guj gave ear, and saluted with his trunk. “I am going
away,” said Deesa.</p>

<p>Moti Guj’s eyes twinkled. He liked jaunts as well as his
master. One could snatch all manner of nice things from the
road-side then.</p>

<p>“But you, you fussy old pig, must stay behind and work.”</p>

<p>The twinkle died out as Moti Guj tried to look delighted. He
hated stump-hauling on the plantation. It hurt his teeth.</p>

<p>“I shall be gone for ten days, oh, delectable one! Hold up
your near forefoot and I’ll impress the fact upon it, warty toad
of a dried mud-puddle.” Deesa took a tent-peg and banged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Moti Guj ten times on the nails. Moti Guj grunted and shuffled
from foot to foot.</p>

<p>“Ten days,” said Deesa, “you will work and haul and root the
trees as Chihun here shall order you. Take up Chihun and set
him on your neck!” Moti Guj curled the tip of his trunk, Chihun
put his foot there, and was swung on to the neck. Deesa handed
Chihun the heavy <i lang="sa">ankus</i>—the iron elephant goad.</p>

<p>Chihun thumped Moti Guj’s bald head as a paver thumps a
curbstone.</p>

<p>Moti Guj trumpeted.</p>

<p>“Be still, hog of the backwoods! Chihun’s your mahout for
ten days. And now bid me good-by, beast after mine own heart.
Oh, my lord, my king! Jewel of all created elephants, lily of the
herd, preserve your honored health; be virtuous. Adieu!”</p>

<p>Moti Guj lapped his trunk round Deesa and swung him into
the air twice. That was his way of bidding him good-by.</p>

<p>“He’ll work now,” said Deesa to the planter. “Have I leave
to go?”</p>

<p>The planter nodded, and Deesa dived into the woods. Moti
Guj went back to haul stumps.</p>

<h5>THE MUTINY</h5>

<p>Chihun was very kind to him, but he felt unhappy and forlorn
for all that. Chihun gave him a ball of spices, and tickled him
under the chin, and Chihun’s little baby cooed to him after work
was over, and Chihun’s wife called him a darling; but Moti Guj
was a bachelor by instinct, as Deesa was. He did not understand
the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref68">domestic emotions</a>. He wanted the light of his universe back
again—the drink and the drunken slumber, the savage beatings
and the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref69">savage caresses</a>.</p>

<p>None the less he worked well, and the planter wondered.
Deesa had wandered along the roads till he met a marriage procession
<a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref70">of his own caste</a>, and, drinking, dancing, and tippling, had
drifted with it past all knowledge of the lapse of time.</p>

<p>The morning of the eleventh day dawned, and there returned
no Deesa. Moti Guj was loosed from his ropes for
the daily stint. He swung clear, looked round, shrugged his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
shoulders, and began to walk away, as one having business
elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Hi! ho! Come back, you!” shouted Chihun. “Come back
and put me on your neck, misborn mountain! Return, splendor
of the hill-sides! <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref71">Adornment of all India</a>, heave to, or I’ll bang
every toe off your fat forefoot!”</p>

<p>Moti Guj gurgled gently, but did not obey. Chihun ran after
him with a rope and caught him up. Moti Guj put his ears forward,
and Chihun knew what that meant, though he tried to carry
it off with high words.</p>

<p>“None of your nonsense with me,” said he. “To your pickets,
devil-son!”</p>

<p>“Hrrump!” said Moti Guj, and that was all—that and the
<a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref72">forebent ears</a>.</p>

<p>Moti Guj put his hands in his pockets, chewed a branch for
a toothpick, and strolled about the clearing, making fun of the
other elephants who had just set to work.</p>

<p>Chihun reported the state of affairs to the planter, who came
out with a dog-whip and cracked it furiously. Moti Guj paid
the white man the compliment of charging him nearly a quarter
of a mile across the clearing and “Hrrumphing” him into his
veranda. Then he stood outside the house, chuckling to himself
and shaking all over with the fun of it as an elephant will.</p>

<p>“We’ll thrash him,” said the planter. “He shall have the
finest thrashing ever elephant received. Give Kala Nag and
Nazim twelve foot of chain apiece, and tell them to lay on
twenty.”</p>

<p>Kala Nag—which means Black Snake—and Nazim were two
of the biggest elephants in the lines, and one of their duties was
to administer the graver punishment, since no man can beat an
elephant properly.</p>

<p>They took the whipping-chains and rattled them in their
trunks as they sidled up to Moti Guj, meaning to hustle him between
them. Moti Guj had never, in all his life of thirty-nine
years, been whipped, and he did not intend to begin a new experience.
So he waited, waving his head from right to left, and
measuring the precise spot in Kala Nag’s fat side where a blunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
tusk could sink deepest. Kala Nag had no tusks; the chain was
the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref73">badge of his authority</a>; but for all that, he swung wide of
Moti Guj at the last minute, and tried to appear as if he had
brought the chain out for amusement. Nazim turned round and
went home early. He did not feel fighting fit that morning and
so Moti Guj was left standing alone with his ears cocked.</p>

<p>That decided the planter to argue no more, and Moti Guj
rolled back to his <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref74">amateur inspection</a> of the clearing. An elephant
who will not work and is not tied up is about as manageable
as an eighty-one-ton gun loose in a heavy seaway. He
slapped old friends on the back and asked them if the stumps
were coming away easily; he talked nonsense concerning labor
and the <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref75">inalienable rights</a> of elephants to a long “nooning”; and,
wandering to and fro, he thoroughly demoralized the garden till
sundown, when he returned to his-picket for food.</p>

<p>“If you won’t work, you shan’t eat,” said Chihun, angrily.
“You’re a wild elephant, and no educated animal at all. Go
back to your jungle.”</p>

<p>Chihun’s little brown baby was rolling on the floor of the hut,
and stretching out its fat arms to the huge shadow in the doorway.
Moti Guj knew well that it was the dearest thing on earth to
Chihun. He swung out his trunk with a <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref76">fascinating crook</a> at
the end, and the brown baby threw itself, shouting, upon it. Moti
Guj made fast and pulled up till the brown baby was crowing in
the air twelve feet above his father’s head.</p>

<p>“Great Lord!” said Chihun. “Flour cakes of the best, twelve
in number, two feet across and soaked in rum, shall be yours on
the instant, and two hundred pounds weight of fresh-cut young
sugar-cane therewith. Deign only to put down safely that insignificant
brat who is my heart and my life to me!”</p>

<p>Moti Guj tucked the brown baby comfortably between his
forefeet, that could have knocked into toothpicks all Chihun’s
hut, and waited for his food. He ate it, and the brown baby
crawled away. Moti Guj dozed and thought of Deesa. One of
many mysteries connected with the elephant is that his huge body
needs less sleep than anything else that lives. Four or five hours
in the night suffice—two just before midnight, lying down on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
side; two just after one o’clock, lying down on the other. The
rest of the silent hours are filled with eating and fidgeting, and
long <a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref77">grumbling soliloquies</a>.</p>

<p>At midnight, therefore, Moti Guj strode out of his pickets, for
a thought had come to him that Deesa might be lying drunk
somewhere in the dark forest with none to look after him. So all
that night he chased through the undergrowth, blowing and trumpeting
and shaking his ears. He went down to the river and
<a href="#phrases3" title="List of phrases" id="ref78">blared across the shallows</a> where Deesa used to wash him, but
there was no answer. He could not find Deesa, but he disturbed
all the other elephants in the lines, and nearly frightened to death
some gypsies in the woods.</p>

<p>At dawn Deesa returned to the plantation. He had been very
drunk indeed, and he expected to get into trouble for outstaying
his leave. He drew a long breath when he saw that the bungalow
and the plantation were still uninjured, for he knew something
of Moti Guj’s temper, and reported himself with many
lies and salaams. Moti Guj had gone to his pickets for breakfast.
The night exercise had made him hungry.</p>

<p>“Call up your beast,” said the planter; and Deesa shouted
in the mysterious elephant language that some mahouts believe
came from China at the birth of the world, when elephants and
not men were masters. Moti Guj heard and came. Elephants do
not gallop. They move from places at varying rates of speed.
If an elephant wished to catch an express train he could not gallop,
but he could catch the train. So Moti Guj was at the planter’s
door almost before Chihun noticed that he had left his pickets.
He fell into Deesa’s arms, trumpeting with joy, and the man and
beast wept and slobbered over each other, and handled each
other from head to heel to see that no harm had befallen.</p>

<p>“Now we will get to work,” said Deesa. “Lift me up, my son
and my joy!”</p>

<p>Moti Guj swung him up, and the two went to the coffee-clearing
to look for difficult stumps.</p>

<p>The planter was too astonished to be very angry.</p>

<h4>THE ELEPHANTS THAT STRUCK</h4>

<p class="author">SAMUEL WHITE BAKER</p>

<p>I remember an occasion many years ago when in Ceylon I,
in connection with my brother, had organized a scheme for the
development of a mountain sanitarium at Newera Ellia. We
had a couple of tame elephants employed in various works; but
it was necessary to obtain the assistance of the government stables
for the transport of very heavy machinery, which could not be
conveyed in the ordinary native carts. There were accordingly
a large number of elephant wagons drawn by their <a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref79">colossal teams</a>,
some of which required four elephants.</p>

<p>It was the wet season upon the mountains. Our settlement
was 6200 feet above the sea, and the zigzag pass from Ramboddé,
at the base of the steep ascent, was fifteen miles in length.
The crest of the pass was 7000 feet in altitude, from which we
descended 800 feet to the Newera Ellia plain.</p>

<p>The elephant wagons having arrived at Ramboddé from
Colombo, about 100 miles distant, commenced the heavy uphill
journey. The rain was unceasing, the roads were soft, and the
heavily laden wagons sank deeply in the ruts; but the elephants
were mighty beasts, and, laying their weight against the work,
they slowly dragged the vehicles up the yielding and narrow
way.</p>

<p>The abrupt zigzags bothered the long wagons and their still
longer teams. The bridges over dangerous chasms <a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref80">entailed the
necessity</a> of unloading the heavier carts, and caused great delay.
Day after day passed away; but although the ascent was slow,
the wagons still moved upwards, and the region of everlasting
mist (at that season) was reached. Dense forests clothed the
mountain sides; the roar of waterfalls resounded in the depths of
black ravines; tangled bamboo grass crept upwards from the wet
soil into the lower branches of the moss-covered trees, and formed
a green curtain impenetrable to sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The thermometer fell daily as the altitude increased. The
elephants began to sicken; two fine animals died. There was
plenty of food, as the bamboo grass was the <a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref81">natural provender</a>,
and in the carts was a good supply of paddy; but the elephants’
<a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref82">intelligence was acting against</a> them—they had reasoned, and
had become despondent.</p>

<p>For nine or ten days they had been exposed to ceaseless wet
and cold, dragging their unmanageable wagons up a road that
even in dry weather was insufficient to sustain the weight. The
wheels sank deep below the metal foundation, and became hopelessly
imbedded. Again and again the wagons had to be emptied
of their contents, and extra elephants were taken from other
carts and harnessed to the empty wagons, which were <a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref83">by sheer
weight</a> of animals dragged from the deep mire.</p>

<p>Thus the time had passed, and the elephants had evidently
<a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref84">reasoned upon the situation</a>, and had concluded that there was
no summit to the mountain, and no end to the steep and horrible
ascent; it would be, therefore, useless to persevere in unavailing
efforts. They determined, under these heart-breaking circumstances,
to strike work; and they did strike.</p>

<p>One morning a couple of the elephant drivers appeared at my
house in Newera Ellia, and described the situation. They declared
that it was absolutely impossible to induce the elephants
to work; they had given it up as a bad job!</p>

<p>I immediately mounted my horse and rode up the pass, and
then descended the road upon the other side, timing the distance
by my watch. Rather under two miles from the summit I found
the road completely blocked with elephant carts and wagons; the
animals were grazing upon bamboo grass in the thick forest; the
rain was drizzling, and a thick mist increased the misery of the
scene. I ordered four elephants to be harnessed to a cart intended
for only one animal. This was quickly effected, and the drivers
were soon astride the animals’ necks, and prodded them with the
<a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref85">persuasive iron hooks</a>. Not an elephant would exert itself to
draw. In vain the drivers, with relentless cruelty, drove the iron
points deep into the poor brutes’ necks and heads, and used every
threat of their vocabulary; the only response was a kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
“<a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref86">marking time</a>” on the part of the elephants, which simply moved
their legs mechanically up and down, and swung their trunks to
and fro; but none would pull or exert the slightest power, neither
did they move forward a single inch!</p>

<p>I never saw such an instance of <a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref87">passive and determined obstinacy</a>;
the case was hopeless.</p>

<p>An idea struck me. I ordered the drivers to detach the four
elephants from the harness, and to ride them thus unfettered up
the pass, following behind my horse. It appeared to me that if
the elephants were heart-broken, and in despair at the apparently
interminable mountain pass, it would be advisable to let them
know the actual truth, by showing them that they were hardly
two miles from the summit, where they would exchange their
uphill labor for a descent into Newera Ellia; they should then
have an extra feed, with plenty of jaggery (a coarse brown
sugar). If they passed an agreeable night, with the best of
food and warm quarters, they would possibly return on the following
day to their work, and with lighter hearts would put their
shoulders to the wheel, instead of yielding to a dogged attitude
of despair.</p>

<p>The success of this ruse was perfect. The elephants accompanied
me to Newera Ellia, and were well fed and cared for. On
the following day we returned to the heavy work, and I myself
witnessed their start with the hitherto unyielding wagon. Not
only did they exert their full powers, and drag the lumbering
load straight up the fatiguing hill without the slightest hesitation,
but their example, or some <a href="#phrases4" title="List of phrases" id="ref88">unaccountable communication</a> between
them, appeared to give general encouragement. I employed the
most willing elephants as extras to each wagon, which they drew
to the summit of the pass, and then returned to assist the others—thus
completing what had been pronounced by the drivers as
utterly impossible. There can be no doubt that the elephants
had at once perceived the situation, and in consequence recovered
their lost courage.</p>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Samuel White Baker (1821-1893) was an English engineer.
At the age of twenty-four he went to Ceylon, where he founded an agricultural
settlement. He soon became known as an explorer and a hunter of
big game. With his wife he explored the region of the Nile, and later
discovered the lake now called Albert Nyanza. His explorations in this
part of central Africa were a part of the thrilling story of the discovery of
the sources of the Nile, and of the opening of this region to civilization.
To know the complete story of these explorations you should read something
about Henry M. Stanley and David Livingstone. An interesting book
covering explorations in Africa is Bayard Taylor’s <cite>Central Africa</cite>.</p>

<p>Upon his return to England, Baker was greatly honored. He was
knighted and sent to Egypt, where he was commissioned by the Khedive
to suppress the slave traffic and establish regular trade. Later he explored
and hunted in Cyprus, Syria, India, Japan, and the United States. He is

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> William Cullen Bryant (1794-1878) was the first great
American poet. He was reared among the rugged Berkshire Hills of
western Massachusetts. Outside the district school, he had little teaching
except that given by his mother and what he gave himself through the
excellent library of his father, who was a country physician. He grew up in
close touch with nature and the simple farm surroundings, and this lonely
life may have tended to make him rather more serious and thoughtful than
most boys of his age. By the time he was nine years old he was putting
his thoughts into verse in the stately fashion of the English poets of that
time. In 1811, when yet scarcely eighteen, he wrote “Thanatopsis,” now
one of the world’s classics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time he had studied two years at a private school and
seven months at Williams College. He was ambitious to continue
his studies at Yale, but his father’s circumstances compelled him to give
up that hope and to face the immediate problem of earning his own living.
He studied law and was admitted to practice in 1815. After a few years
he went to New York, where in 1825 he became editor of the <cite>Evening Post</cite>—a
position which he continued to fill with distinction for more than half
a century, until his death in 1878.</p>

<p>And yet this busy editor of a great city newspaper found leisure from
time to time to cultivate his love for verse and to continue to write poetry.
His poems were popular with Americans because he chose for the most
part American subjects taken from his own immediate surroundings and
experience—the scenes and impressions of his boyhood, the flowers, the
birds, the hills, the climate of his own New England.</p>

<p>America’s first men of letters whose writings proved that the new
republic could produce a literature worthy to be compared with that of
the mother country were James Fenimore Cooper, writer of Indian tales;
Washington Irving, writer of legends about America and the sketches
about our old English home; and William Cullen Bryant. Cooper showed
the strangeness and romance of frontier life. Irving tried to give to
America the romantic background that the new country lacked. Bryant
opened men’s eyes to the beauty of nature.</p>

<p>Though Bryant was eleven years younger than Irving, his “Thanatopsis”
was written only two years after Irving’s “Knickerbocker.”</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> The bobolink is an American song bird. In the spring the male
is mostly black and white, while the female is streaked with yellowish
brown. In midsummer the male bobolink molts, taking on “plain brown”
plumage like that of his “Quaker wife.” In the spring he regains his black
and buff colors without molting any feathers. He sings only in the spring.
The bobolink makes long migrations extending from Canada to Paraguay,
and in the late autumn collects in large flocks which feed in the rice fields of
the South, where he is known as the <em>ricebird</em>, or <em>reedbird</em>.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Read the lines that imitate the song of the bobolink.
2. Describe the dress of Robert of Lincoln and that of his “Quaker wife.”
3. How does her song differ from his? 4. What are the work and the care
that make him silent? 5. How does the poet account for the change in
his appearance as the season advances? 6. Where does he go for winter?
When will he come again?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Henry van Dyke (1852-⸺) was born in Germantown,
which is now a part of the city of Philadelphia. When a small boy, his
parents moved to Brooklyn. He was graduated from Princeton College in
1873 and from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1877. For several
years he was pastor of the Brick Presbyterian Church in New York City.
Later he was made professor of English Literature at Princeton University,
which position he still holds. In 1913 Dr. van Dyke was appointed United
States Minister to Holland, where he lived during the early years of the
World War. He has written many stories and poems of great literary
charm.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809-1892) was poet laureate of
England, succeeding Wordsworth. This means that he was appointed to
write poems about matters of national interest, such as his ode on the
death of the Duke of Wellington; and that he also expressed something
of the national spirit of England, as in his poems about King Arthur
(<cite>The Idylls of the King</cite>) and in many poems about his native land. He
was born in Lincolnshire and studied at Trinity College, Cambridge.
He lived a quiet life and devoted himself to poetry, in which he excelled
in beauty of expression and choice of words. You will learn to know
him as a teller of tales in verse, these tales being both modern ballads and
romances about King Arthur; as a writer of many lovely song-poems or
lyrics; and as a poet of religious faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Note.</b> The song-thrush, or throstle, is found in most parts of England,
and is one of the finest songsters in Europe. Its note is rich and mellow.
This is the bird of which Browning wrote,</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Which lines in the first stanza represent the song of
the bird? 2. Which line gives Tennyson’s answer to the throstle? 3. Point
out the words in the poem that represent the bird’s song. 4. Which lines
tell you that Tennyson did not share the little bird’s hope? 5, What do
the last two lines show that the bird did for the poet?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> William Wordsworth (1770-1850) was born in the beautiful
Cumberland Highlands of northern England, which furnished the
inspiration for most of his poetry. While still a young man, he retired to
the beautiful Lake Country of northern England, where he lived a simple
life. He was devoted to the cause of liberty; he was a believer in the
beauty and charm of the humble life; he often wrote about peasants rather
than about lords and ladies and knights of romance. His flower poems and
bird poems show the simplicity and sincerity of his nature.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> The cuckoo is a European bird noted for its two-syllable whistle,
in imitation of which it is named; also for its habit of laying eggs in the
nests of other birds for them to hatch, instead of building a nest of its own.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Why does the poet call the cuckoo “a wandering voice”?
2. What other names does the poet call the cuckoo? 3. To what habit of
the cuckoo does this poem call attention? 4. Why does the poet say a
“fairy place” is a fit home for the cuckoo? 5. What “golden time” is
mentioned?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> James Russell Lowell (1819-1891) came of one of the
oldest and most influential New England families. Born in an atmosphere
of learning, in the old family home in historic Cambridge, at the very doors
of Harvard College, he enjoyed every advantage for culture that inherited
tastes, ample means, and convenient opportunity could offer. Besides the
facilities of the college near by, his father’s library, in which he roamed at
will from his very infancy, was one of the richest in the whole country. It
is not strange, then, that he grew to be one of the most scholarly Americans
of his time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>After leaving college he studied law and opened an office in Boston.
He became deeply interested in the political issues of the times and was
thus stirred to his first serious efforts in literature. In 1848 appeared his
“Vision of Sir Launfal,” founded upon the legend of the Holy Grail, and
one of the most spiritually beautiful poems in any literature. Few patriotic
poems surpass his “Commemoration Ode.” Besides his poetical works he
wrote many essays and books of travel and of criticism. He succeeded Longfellow
in his professorship at Harvard, and was the first editor of the <cite>Atlantic
Monthly</cite>. He served successively as Minister to Spain and to England.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. In the first stanza, how does the poet account for the
violet’s eyes being “full of tears”? 2. To the poet what does the violet
represent? 3. What vision does the violet bring to the poet? 4. How
does the poet account for the color of the violet? 5. What change in the
poet’s feeling is noted in the fourth stanza? 6. From what does the poet
say his soul must “take hue”? 7. How does the poet in the last lines of
the poem account for the violet’s eyes being “full of tears”?</p>

gold differ from it? 8. Explain the last three lines of stanza 2, and name
any other common things we do not value enough. 9. How can the poet

in the heart, and heed not space or time”? 11. Has a poet more vivid imagination
than other people? Why? 12. Compare the expression “eyes are in
the heart, and heed not space or time” with that of Wordsworth in “The

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> John Greenleaf Whittier (1807-1892) was born near the
little town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, in the same county as Salem, the
birthplace of Hawthorne. The old farmhouse in which Whittier was born
was built by the poet’s great-great-grandfather. It still stands to mark the
site of the old home. His family were Quakers, sturdy of stature as of
character. Whittier’s boyhood was in complete contrast to that of Lowell
or Longfellow. He led the life of a typical New England farm boy, used
to hard work, no luxuries, and few pleasures. His library consisted of practically
one book, the family Bible, which was later supplemented by a copy
of Burns’s poems, loaned him by the district schoolmaster. Whittier is often
compared with Burns in the simple homeliness of his style, his patriotism,
his fiery indignation at wrong, and his sympathy with the humble and
the oppressed.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Where did the poet find “the trailing spring flower”?
2. Have you found it? Where? When? 3. What beautiful thought came
to the poet while he bent over the arbutus? 4. Have you known lowly
lives that made the earth happier by their presence? 5. The poet <em>found</em>
the lowly flower that lends “sweetness to the ungenial day”; can we find the
lowly person who “makes the earth happier”? 6. What does Nature teach
through the lowly trailing arbutus? 7. What other selections by this author
have you read?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Robert Burns (1759-1796) was a Scottish poet, whose home
was near Ayr, in Scotland. His life was short and filled with poverty
and hardship, but he saw beauty in the common things of life and had a
heart full of sympathy. He wrote this poem at a time when he was in
great trouble. His farm was turning out badly, the soil was sour and wet,
his crops were failures, and he saw nothing but ruin before him. Burns’s
tenderness and sympathy are shown in the feeling expressed in this poem
at crushing the flower.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. How does the English daisy, which Burns describes in
the first line of the poem, differ from the daisy that you know, the American
daisy? 2. Select and give the meaning of words that illustrate Burns’s use
of the Scotch dialect. 3. Picture the incident related in the first stanza.
4. What do you know about the lark that helps you to understand why it
is called the daisy’s “companion” and “neebor”? 5. What comparison is
made between the daisy and the garden flowers? 6. What “share” is mentioned
in stanza 5? 7. What characteristic of the flower does Burns seem to
like best?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> John Keats (1795-1821) was of humble birth, being the
son of a London stablekeeper. He lived at the time of Wordsworth, Byron,
Shelley, and Leigh Hunt, from all of whom he gathered inspiration. His
years were few, and his fame did not come while he was living. He had a
passion for beauty, which found expression in all his poetry. On account of
failing health he went to Rome in 1820, where he died the year following.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Why does the poet say sweet peas are “on tiptoe for a
flight”? 2. What are the wings of the sweet pea? 3. The poet tells of the
perfect stillness of the moving water in the stream; what words does he
use in lines immediately preceding to prepare you for this stillness? 4.
What picture does the last sentence of the poem give you?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biographical and Historical Note.</b> Leigh Hunt (1784-1859) was an
English poet, journalist, and essayist. He was a personal friend of Shelley
and Byron, and an intimate friend of Keats. His poems and essays are
marked by a delightful style.</p>

<p>The “Nine” (stanza 7) refers to the Muses, patronesses of poetry and
music, whose lord is Apollo, and who assembled on Mount Parnassus or
Mount Helicon, to hold learned discussions on poetry, science, or music.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. What is a chorus? 2. Who are the singers? 3. What
is the purpose of their song? 4. When you look at a flower, what things
are you apt to notice about it? 5. Name a poem you have read that
tells of the uses of a flower. 6. What poem that you have read in
this book celebrates the color of the flower? 7. What familiar custom
grows out of the belief that “unto sorrow we give smiles”? That “unto
graces [we give] graces”? 8. For what purpose are flowers in “a thousand
flashing hues”? 9. What things are compared in the last line of stanza 4?
10. What uses of flowers are pointed out in stanza 5? 11. In stanza 7 what
is compared with the “Nine” muses? 12. Read the lines that tell what
lesson the sea-weeds teach. 13. What does the last stanza suggest as a
possible source and use of flowers? 14. Which stanza do you like best?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Joyce Kilmer (1886-1918) was born in New Brunswick,
N. J. He was one of the first Americans to be deeply moved by Germany’s
challenge to humanity. He gave up his journalistic career in New York,
and enlisted seventeen days after the United States declared war. He was
attached to the Intelligence Department of the army, one of his duties
being to precede the troops before an attack and find out the positions of
the enemy guns. He served during almost the whole of the battle
of the Marne until August first, 1918, when he received a mortal wound.
Kilmer was the first American man of letters to be killed in the war. At
the time of his enlistment he was the editor of poetry for the <cite>Literary Digest</cite>.</p>

<h4>THE GREAT BLIZZARD</h4>

<p class="author">HAMLIN GARLAND</p>

<p>A blizzard on the prairie corresponds to a storm at sea; it never
affects the traveler twice alike. Each norther seems to have a
manner of attack all its own. One storm may be short, sharp,
high-keyed, and malevolent, while another approaches slowly,
relentlessly, wearing out the souls of its victims by its inexorable
and long-continued cold and gloom. One threatens for hours
before it comes, the other leaps like a tiger upon the <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref189">defenseless
settlement</a>, catching the children unhoused, the men unprepared;
of this character was the first blizzard Lincoln ever saw.</p>

<p>The day was warm and sunny. The eaves <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref190">dripped musically</a>,
and the icicles dropping from the roof fell occasionally with pleasant
crash. The snow grew slushy, and the bells of wood teams
jingled merrily all the forenoon, as the farmers drove to their
timber-lands five or six miles away. The room was uncomfortably
warm at times, and the master opened the outside door. It
was the eighth day of January. One afternoon recess, as the boys
were playing in their shirt-sleeves, Lincoln called Milton’s attention
to a great cloud rising in the west and north. A vast, slaty-blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref191">seamless dome</a>, silent, portentous, with edges of silvery
frosty light.</p>

<p>“It’s going to storm,” said Milton. “It always does when we
have a south wind and a cloud like that in the west.”</p>

<p>When Lincoln set out for home, the sun was still shining, but
the edge of the cloud had crept, or more properly slid, across the
sun’s disk, and its light was growing cold and pale. In fifteen
minutes more the wind from the south ceased—there was a
moment of <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref192">breathless pause</a>, and then, borne on the wings of the
north wind, the streaming clouds of soft, large flakes of snow
drove in a level line over the homeward-bound scholars, sticking
to their clothing and faces and melting rapidly. It was not yet
cold enough to freeze, though the wind was colder. The growing
darkness troubled Lincoln most.</p>

<p>By the time he reached home, the wind was a gale, the snow
a vast blinding cloud, filling the air and hiding the road. Darkness
came on instantly, and the wind increased in power, as
though with the momentum of the snow. Mr. Stewart came
home early, yet the breasts of his horses were already <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref193">sheathed
in snow</a>. Other teamsters passed, breasting the storm, and calling
cheerily to their horses. One team, containing a woman and
two men, neighbors living seven miles north, gave up the contest,
and turned in at the gate for shelter, confident that they would
be able to go on in the morning. In the barn, while rubbing the
ice from the horses, the men joked and told stories in a jovial
spirit, with the feeling generally that all would be well by daylight.
The boys made merry also, singing songs, popping corn,
playing games, in defiance of the storm.</p>

<p>But when they went to bed, at ten o’clock, Lincoln felt some
<a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref194">vague premonition</a> of a <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref195">dread disturbance</a> of nature, far beyond
any other experience in his short life. The wind howled like ten
thousand tigers, and the cold grew more and more intense. The
wind seemed to drive in and through the frail tenement; water
and food began to freeze within ten feet of the fire.</p>

<p>Lincoln thought the wind at that hour had attained its utmost
fury, but when he awoke in the morning, he saw how mistaken he
had been. He crept to the fire, appalled by the steady, solemn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref196">implacable clamor</a> of the storm. It was like the roarings of all
the lions of Africa, the hissing of a wilderness of serpents, the
lashing of great trees. It benumbed his thinking, it appalled his
heart, beyond any other force he had ever known.</p>

<p>The house shook and snapped, the snow beat in muffled, <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref197">rhythmic
pulsations</a> against the walls, or swirled and lashed upon the
roof, giving rise to strange, <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref198">multitudinous sounds</a>; now dim and
far, now near and all-surrounding; producing an effect of mystery
and infinite reach, as though the cabin were a helpless boat,
tossing on an angry, limitless sea.</p>

<p>Looking out, there was nothing to be seen but the lashing of
the wind and snow. When the men attempted to face it, to go to
the rescue of the cattle, they found the air impenetrably filled
with fine, powdery snow, mixed with the dirt caught up from the
plowed fields by a terrific blast, moving ninety miles an hour.
It was impossible to see twenty feet, except at long intervals.
Lincoln could not see at all when facing the storm. When he
stepped into the wind, his face was coated with ice and dirt, as
by a dash of mud—a mask which blinded the eyes, and instantly
froze to his cheeks. Such was the power of the wind that he
could not breathe an instant unprotected. His mouth being once
open, it was impossible to draw breath again without turning
from the wind.</p>

<p>The day was spent in keeping warm and in feeding the stock
at the barn, which Mr. Stewart reached by desperate dashes,
during the momentary clearing of the air following some more
than usually strong gust. Lincoln attempted to water the horses
from the pump, but the wind blew the water out of the pail. So
cold had the wind become that a dipperful, thrown into the air,
fell as ice. In the house it became more and more difficult to
remain cheerful, notwithstanding the family had fuel and food in
abundance.</p>

<p>Oh, that terrible day! Hour after hour they listened to that
prodigious, appalling, ferocious uproar. All day Lincoln and
Owen moved restlessly to and fro, asking each other, “Won’t it
ever stop?” To them the storm now seemed too vast; too ungovernable,
to ever again be spoken to a calm, even by God Himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to Lincoln that no power whatever could control such
fury; his imagination was unable to conceive of a force greater
than this war of wind or snow.</p>

<p>On the third day the family rose with weariness, and looked
into each other’s faces with a sort of horrified surprise. Not
even the invincible heart of Duncan Stewart, nor the cheery good
nature of his wife, could keep a gloomy silence from settling down
upon the house. Conversation was scanty; nobody laughed that
day, but all listened anxiously to the <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref199">invisible tearing</a> at the shingles,
beating against the door, and shrieking around the eaves.
The frost upon the windows, nearly half an inch thick in the
morning, kept thickening into ice, and the light was dim at mid-day.
The fire melted the snow on the window-panes and upon
the door, while around the key-hole and along every crack, frost
formed. The men’s faces began to wear a grim, set look, and the
women sat with awed faces and downcast eyes full of unshed
tears, their sympathies going out to the poor travelers, lost and
freezing.</p>

<p>The men got to the poor dumb animals that day to feed them;
to water them was impossible. Mr. Stewart went down through
the roof of the shed, the door being completely sealed up with
solid banks of snow and dirt. One of the guests had a wife and
two children left alone in a small cottage six miles farther on, and
physical force was necessary to keep him from setting out in face
of the deadly tempest. To him the nights seemed weeks, and the
days interminable, as they did to the rest, but it would have been
death to venture out.</p>

<p>That night, so disturbed had all become, they lay awake listening,
waiting, hoping for a change. About midnight Lincoln
noticed that the roar was no longer so steady, so relentless, and
so high-keyed as before. It began to lull at times, and though
it came back to the attack with all its former ferocity, still there
was a <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref200">perceptible weakening</a>. Its fury was <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref201">becoming spasmodic</a>.
One of the men shouted down to Mr. Stewart, “The storm is over,”
and when the host called back a ringing word of cheer, Lincoln
sank into deep sleep in sheer relief.</p>

<p>Oh, the joy with which the children melted the ice on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
window-panes, and peered out on the familiar landscape, dazzling,
peaceful, under the brilliant sun and wide blue sky. Lincoln
looked out over the wide plain, ridged with vast drifts; on
the far blue line of timber, on the near-by cottages sending up
cheerful columns of smoke (as if to tell him the neighbors were
alive), and his heart seemed to fill his throat. But the wind was
with him still, for so long and continuous had its voice sounded
in his ears, that even in the perfect calm his imagination supplied
its loss with fainter, fancied roarings.</p>

<p>Out in the barn the horses and cattle, hungry and cold, kicked
and bellowed in pain, and when the men dug them out, they ran
and raced like mad creatures, to start the blood circulating in
their numbed and stiffened limbs. Mr. Stewart was forced to
tunnel to the barn door, cutting through the hard snow as if it
were clay. The drifts were solid, and the dirt mixed with the
snow was disposed on the surface in beautiful wavelets, like the
sands at the bottom of a lake. The drifts would bear a horse.
The guests were able to go home by noon, climbing above the
fences, and rattling across the plowed ground.</p>

<p>And then in the days which followed, came grim tales of suffering
and heroism. Tales of the finding of stage-coaches with the
driver frozen on his seat and all his passengers within; tales of
travelers striving to reach home and families. Cattle had starved
and frozen in their stalls, and sheep lay buried in heaps beside the
fences where they had clustered together to keep warm. These
days gave Lincoln a new conception of the prairies. It taught
him that however bright and beautiful they might be in summer
under skies of June, they could be terrible when the Norther was
abroad in his wrath. They seemed now as pitiless and destructive
as the polar ocean. It seemed as if nothing could live there
unhoused. All was at the mercy of that power, the north wind,
whom only the Lord Sun could tame.</p>

<p>This was the worst storm of the winter, though the wind
seemed never to sleep. To and fro, from north to south, and
south to north, the dry snow sifted till it was like fine sand that
rolled under the heel with a ringing sound on cold days. After
each storm the restless wind got to work to pile the new-fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
flakes into ridges behind every fence or bush, filling every ravine
and forcing the teamsters into the fields and out on to the open
prairie. It was a savage and gloomy time for Lincoln, with only
the pleasure of his school to break the <a href="#phrases20" title="List of phrases" id="ref202">monotony of cold</a>.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Hamlin Garland (1860-⸺) was born in Wisconsin. His
father was a farmer-pioneer, who, always eager to be upon the border line
of agricultural development, moved from Wisconsin to Minnesota, from
Minnesota to Iowa, and from Iowa to Dakota. The hope of cheaper acres,
better soil, and bigger crops lured him on.</p>

<p>When Hamlin Garland turned his attention to literature he was keen
enough to see the literary value of his early experiences. He resolved
to interpret truthfully the life of the western farmer and its great hardships
and limitations, no less than its hopes, joys, and achievements. In doing
this, through a succession of short stories and novels, he won fame and
success. In <cite>A Son of the Middle Border</cite>, an autobiography, he has written
an intensely interesting and valuable record of typical experiences in the
development of the Middle West. This selection is taken from <cite>Boy Life on
the Prairie</cite>.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. What distinguishes a blizzard from other violent storms?
2. What are the dangers when it comes without ample warning? 3. What
was the manner of attack of this blizzard? 4. What caused the early darkness?
5. What was it in the storm that “appalled” the boy’s heart and
“benumbed his thinking”? 6. What effect had it upon other members
of the household? 7. Has man any power to oppose the violence of such
a storm? 8. What was the velocity of the wind? 9. How long did the
blizzard last? How did it compare in this respect with the ordinary blizzard?
10. What name was given it because of its force, fury, and duration? 11.

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882) was a native of
Boston, born not far from Franklin’s birthplace. He was the oldest among
that brilliant group of New England scholars and writers that developed
under the influence of Harvard College. Emerson was a quiet boy, but that
he had high ambitions and sturdy determination is shown by the fact that
he worked his own way through college. He is best known for his essays,
full of noble ideas and wise philosophy, but he also wrote poetry. As a poet
he was careless of his meter, making his lines often purposely rugged,
but they are always charged and bristling with thoughts that shock
and thrill like electric batteries. In 1836 he wrote the “Concord Hymn”
containing the famous lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Here once the embattled farmers stood</div>
<div class="verse">And fired the shot heard round the world!”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>His poems of nature are clear-cut and vivid as snapshots. “The Humble
Bee,” as a critic puts it, “seems almost to shine with the heat and light of
summer.”</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Picture the scene described in the first five lines. 2.
Compare with the picture given you in the first stanza of “Snow-Flakes,”
page 80. 3. Read in a way to bring out the contrast between the wild storm
and the scene within the “farmhouse at the garden’s end.” 4. What is meant
by “fierce artificer”? 5. What is the “tile” with which the poet imagines
the “unseen quarry” is furnished? 6. Of what are the “white bastions”
made? 7. Does the use of the word “windward” add to the picture and
does such detail add to the beauty of the poem or detract from it? 8. Who
is described as “myriad-handed”? 9. What is the mockery in hanging
“Parian wreaths” on a coop or kennel? 10. What picture do lines 20, 21,
and 22 give you? 11. What does the “mad wind’s night-work” do for Art?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882) was born in
Portland, Maine. In “The Courtship of Miles Standish” he has made us
acquainted with his ancestors, John Alden and Priscilla Mullens, passengers
on the <i>Mayflower</i>.</p>

<p>Longfellow’s education was obtained in Portland and at Bowdoin
College, where he had for classmates several youths who afterward became
famous, notably, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Franklin Pierce. Upon Longfellow’s
graduation, the trustees of the college, having decided to establish
a chair of modern languages, proposed that this young graduate should
fit himself for the position. Three years, therefore, he spent in delightful
study and travel in France, Spain, Italy, and Germany. Here was laid
the foundation for his scholarship, and, as in Irving on his first European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
trip, there was kindled that passion for romantic lore which followed him
through life and which gave direction to much of his work. He mastered the
language of each country visited, in a remarkably short time, and many of
the choicer poems found in these languages he has given to us in English.
After five years at Bowdoin, Longfellow was invited in 1834 to the
chair of modern languages in Harvard College. Again he was given an
opportunity to prepare himself by a year of study abroad. In 1836 he
began his active work at Harvard and took up his residence in the historic
Craigie House, overlooking the Charles River—a house in which Washington
had been quartered for some months when he came to Cambridge
in 1775 to take command of the Continental forces. Longfellow was
thenceforth one of the most prominent members of that group of men
including Sumner, Hawthorne, Agassiz, Lowell, and Holmes, who gave
distinction to the Boston and Cambridge of earlier days.</p>

<p>For twenty years Longfellow served as a teacher, introducing hundreds
of students to the literature of modern Europe. In his poetry, too, he
exerted a powerful influence for bringing about a relationship between
America and European civilization. He was thus a poet of culture, rendering
a great service at a time when the thought of America was provincial.
He was also a poet of the household, writing many poems about the joys and
sorrows of home life, poems of aspiration and religious faith, poems about
village characters as well as about national heroes. He excels, too, as a
writer of tales in verse. “Evangeline,” a story of the Acadian exiles and
their wanderings; “The Courtship of Miles Standish,” a story of early
colonial life in Massachusetts; and “Hiawatha,” an Indian epic into which
he put a vast amount of legendary matter belonging to the first owners of
our country, are examples of his power in sustained verse narrative. His
ballads, such as “The Skeleton in Armor” and “The Wreck of the Hesperus,”
show his power to handle a legend in brief and stirring form. He was a
writer of almost perfect sonnets, and a writer of prose of distinction. The
most loved and most widely known of American poets, Longfellow helped
to interpret our common life in terms of beauty.</p>

how “the troubled heart” makes “confession in the countenance.”
5. How does the poet fancy “the troubled sky” reveals its grief? 6. What is

poem of the air” is recorded? 8. What is “whispered and revealed”?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was the greatest English
poet, and was one of the greatest poets the world has ever known. He
wrote for all times and all peoples. He was born at Stratford-on-Avon,
where fifty-two years later he died. At the age of twenty-two he removed
to London, where for twenty years he wrote poems and plays, was an actor,
and later a shareholder in the theater. The last six years of his life he spent
quietly at Stratford.</p>

<p>This song is from the comedy <cite>As You Like It</cite>, a story of the adventures
of a group of courtiers and rustics in the forest of Arden. A charming
element in Shakespeare’s romantic comedies is the introduction of song-poems
or lyrics. All the writers of those days, the days of Good Queen
Bess, wrote songs. England was “a nest of singing birds.” They were
real songs, too, filled with joy and musical language, and all the people
sang them to the accompaniment of the quaint musical instruments of
the time. And all the people took part in games and pageants in “Merrie
England,” and listened to the strange tales of seafarers, and went to the
playhouse to see Shakespeare’s <cite>As You Like It</cite>.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Why is the thought of green holly appropriate in connection
with the winter wind? 2. What feeling does ingratitude arouse?
3. Why does the poet say the “tooth” of the wind is not so keen as man’s
ingratitude? 4. What change of feeling do you notice after line 6? 5.
What do you think caused the change? 6. In the second stanza read lines
that show the poet did not really think that “life is most jolly.” 7. Which
lines explain the poet’s distrust of friendship? 8. Which word in stanza I
is explained by line 3 of stanza 2? 9. Find a word in stanza 1 that gives
the same thought as the second line of the second stanza. 10. Give the
meaning of “warp” in stanza 2 (an old Saxon proverb said, “Winter shall
warp water”).</p>

<h3 id="II_INTRO">ADVENTURES OLD AND NEW<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></h3>

<p>Along with our interest in the world of animals and the plant
world and the seasons, we are curious to know about people.
A good deal of our conversation is about what others say or do.
And when we say of a man, “He <em>does</em> things,” we pay him the
highest possible compliment.</p>

<p>Ever since man came on the earth he has been “doing things.”
Centuries ago, a man found out how to make fire by striking
pieces of flint together. Then other men discovered strange
things that might be done by means of the mysterious flame
that sprang up. Another man ventured over the hill or mountain
out into the unknown world beyond, or far across the blue water
that seemed to reach to the end of the world. And when the
traveler returned, men listened eagerly to his stories. So from
earliest days men who ventured beyond the beaten track and
did things their fellows were too lazy or too timid to think of
doing have been interesting to those who stayed at home. In
such ways ships were built to carry voyagers to strange places.
In such ways commerce sprang up, for these adventurers brought
back new foods and new objects, and knowledge of men who lived
in strange places. In such ways islands and continents were
discovered and settled, and men made war for the possession of
rich territories, and life for all men became more varied and
interesting through the adventures of the daring ones. For life
is full of zest and interest only in proportion as the spirit of
adventure enters into it.</p>

<p>The men in former times who stood out above their fellows
because of their deeds were the subjects of song and story.
Minstrels and poets in all times have put into words the wonder
and admiration of the people for the doer of great deeds. Some
stories of this kind you will read in the pages that follow—just
a few of the thousands of stories of adventure that men have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
told in song and prose tale. Some of these stories introduce
King Arthur and his Round Table, in the days of chivalry, when
knighthood was in flower. A few of them are old ballads, which
are tales made by the people or by some of their number, and
sung by the people or by minstrels, or by mothers to their children,
and so handed down from one generation to another. And some
of them are very recent indeed, for they spring out of the heroic
deeds of men in the World War that ended in November, 1918.</p>

<p>This spirit of adventure that makes men willing to face danger,
and even death, to get some new experience or to render some
service, the spirit that makes some men explore strange places,
or seek for the South Pole, or fight in great battles—this spirit
of adventure never dies. Sometimes the story is of a knight clad
in armor, and sometimes it is about a man in khaki who died the
other day that his fellows might live—the spirit is the same. Men
no longer dress like Lancelot, or like George Washington, but
they do the same sort of things. And people like to read of these
things or hear the stories told just as much now as they did when
the first traveler returned to the little village in Greece, or when
Sir Gareth and Sir Gawain won their victories, or when General
Putnam or Mad Anthony Wayne, in our Revolutionary War, performed
some brave act for the American cause. And now, all over
the world, groups gather about the soldier who has returned from
Flanders Fields with his stories of valor. Always the spirit of
adventure lives; always we like to hear what it brings back to
us of news about life. If we have had no chance yet to do a thing
worth men’s praise, we get a larger view of life, a better sense of
what life really means, from reading or hearing such stories.
And we mean to do brave things ourselves, some day, so the stories
thrill us with the sense of what life holds for us.</p>

<p>These things we must remember, then, as we read. Through
these stories we become partners in all the brave deeds of the
past. And, again, the spirit of adventure is ever-living and is
as keen today as in the past. And, finally, by such stories our
own knowledge of the fine qualities of human nature is increased
and our own experience enlarged so that we become braver
and better because we see what wonderful things life can bring.</p>

<h4>KING ARTHUR STORIES</h4>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Coming of Arthur</span></h5>

<h6>OF THE BIRTH OF ARTHUR AND HOW HE BECAME KING</h6>

<p>Long years ago, there ruled over Britain a king called Uther
Pendragon. A mighty prince was he, and feared by all men;
yet, when he sought the love of the fair Igraine of Cornwall, she
would have naught to do with him, so that, from grief and disappointment,
Uther fell sick, and at last seemed like to die.</p>

<p>Now in those days, there lived a famous magician named
Merlin, so powerful that he could change his form at will, or even
make himself invisible; nor was there any place so remote but
that he could reach it at once, merely by wishing himself there.
One day, suddenly he stood at Uther’s bedside, and said:</p>

<p>“Sir King, I know thy grief, and am ready to help thee. Only
promise to give me, at his birth, the son that shall be born to
thee, and thou shalt have thy heart’s desire.”</p>

<p>To this the King agreed joyfully, and Merlin kept his word:
for he gave Uther the form of one whom Igraine had loved dearly,
and so she took him willingly for her husband.</p>

<p>When the time had come that a child should be born to the
King and Queen, Merlin appeared before Uther to remind him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of his promise; and Uther swore it should be as he had said.
Three days later, a prince was born and, with pomp and ceremony,
was christened by the name of Arthur; but immediately
thereafter the King commanded that the child should be carried
to the postern-gate, there to be given to the old man who would
be found waiting without.</p>

<p>Not long after, Uther fell sick, and he knew that his end was
come; so, by Merlin’s advice, he called together his knights and
barons and said to them:</p>

<p>“My death draws near. I charge you, therefore, that ye obey
my son even as ye have obeyed me; and my curse upon him if he
claim not the crown when he is a man grown.”</p>

<p>Then the King turned his face to the wall and died.</p>

<p>Scarcely was Uther laid in his grave before disputes arose.
Few of the nobles had seen Arthur or even heard of him, and
not one of them would have been willing to be ruled by a child;
rather, each thought himself fitted to be king, and, strengthening
his own castle, made war on his neighbors until <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref245">confusion alone
was supreme</a>, and the poor groaned because there was none to
help them.</p>

<p>Now when Merlin carried away Arthur—for Merlin was the
old man who had stood at the postern-gate—he had known all
that would happen, and had taken the child to keep him safe from
the fierce barons until he should be of age to rule wisely and well,
and perform all the wonders prophesied of him. He gave the child
to the care of the good knight Sir Ector to bring him up with his
son Kay, but revealed not to him that it was the son of Uther
Pendragon that was given into his charge.</p>

<p>At last, when years had passed and Arthur was grown a tall
youth well skilled in <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref246">knightly exercises</a>, Merlin went to the Archbishop
of Canterbury and advised him that he should call together
at Christmas-time all the chief men of the realm to the great
cathedral in London.</p>

<p>“For,” said Merlin, “there shall be seen a great marvel by
which it shall be made clear to all men who is the lawful king of
this land.” The Archbishop did as Merlin counseled. Under
<a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref247">pain of a fearful curse</a>, he bade barons and knights come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
London to keep the feast, and to pray heaven to send peace to
the realm.</p>

<p>The people hastened to obey the Archbishop’s commands and,
from all sides, barons and knights came riding in to keep the
birth-feast of our Lord. And when they had prayed, and were
coming forth from the cathedral, they saw a strange sight. There,
in the open space before the church, stood, on a great stone, an
anvil thrust through with a sword; and on the stone were written
these words:</p>

<p>“Whoso can draw forth this sword is rightful King of Britain
born.”</p>

<p>At once there were fierce quarrels, each man clamoring to be
the first to try his fortune, none doubting his own success. Then
the Archbishop decreed that each should make the venture in
turn, from the greatest baron to the least knight; and each in
turn, having put forth his utmost strength, failed to move the
sword one inch, and drew back ashamed. So the Archbishop
dismissed the company, and having appointed guards to watch
over the stone, sent messengers through all the land to give word
of <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref248">great jousts</a> to be held in London at Easter, when each knight
could give proof of his skill and courage, and try whether the
adventure of the sword was for him.</p>

<p>Among those who rode to London at Easter was the good Sir
Ector, and with him his son, Sir Kay, newly made a knight, and
the young Arthur. When the morning came that the jousts
should begin, Sir Kay and Arthur mounted their horses and set
out for the lists; but before they reached the field, Kay looked
and saw that he had left his sword behind. Immediately Arthur
turned back to fetch it for him, only to find the house fast shut,
for all were gone to view the tournament. <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref249">Sore vexed</a> was Arthur,
fearing lest his brother Kay should lose his chance of gaining
glory, till, of a sudden, he bethought him of the sword in the
great anvil before the cathedral. Thither he rode with all speed,
and the guards having deserted their posts to view the tournament,
there was none to forbid him the adventure. He leaped
from his horse, seized the hilt, and instantly drew forth the sword
as easily as from a scabbard; then, mounting his horse and thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
no marvel of what he had done, he rode after his brother and
handed him the weapon.</p>

<p>When Kay looked at it, he saw at once that it was the wondrous
sword from the stone. In great joy he sought his father,
and showing it to him, said:</p>

<p>“Then must I be King of Britain.”</p>

<p>But Sir Ector bade him say how he came by the sword, and
when Sir Kay told how Arthur had brought it to him, Sir Ector
bent his knee to the boy and said:</p>

<p>“Sir, I perceive that ye are my King, and here I <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref250">tender you
my homage</a>”; and Kay did as his father. Then the three sought
the Archbishop, to whom they related all that had happened; and
he, much marveling, called the people together to the great stone,
and bade Arthur thrust back the sword and draw it forth again
in the presence of all, which he did with ease. But an angry
murmur arose from the barons, who cried that what a boy could
do, a man could do; so, at the Archbishop’s word, the sword was
put back, and each man, whether baron or knight, tried in his
turn to draw it forth, and failed. Then, for the third time, Arthur
drew forth the sword. Immediately there arose from the people
a great shout:</p>

<p>“Arthur is King! Arthur is King! We will have no King but
Arthur”; and, though the great barons scowled and threatened,
they fell on their knees before him while the Archbishop placed
the crown upon his head, and they swore to obey him faithfully
as their lord and sovereign.</p>

<p>Thus Arthur was made king; and to all he did justice, righting
wrongs and giving to all their dues. Nor was he forgetful of
those that had been his friends; for Kay, whom he loved as a
brother, he made seneschal and chief of his household, and to
Sir Ector, his <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref251">foster father</a>, he gave broad lands.</p>

<h6>HOW KING ARTHUR TOOK A WIFE, AND OF THE TABLE ROUND</h6>

<p>Thus Arthur was made king, but he had to fight for his own;
for eleven great kings drew together and refused to acknowledge
him as their lord, and chief amongst the rebels was King Lot of
Orkney, who had married Arthur’s sister, Bellicent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>By Merlin’s advice Arthur sent for help overseas, to Ban
and Bors, the two great Kings who ruled in Gaul. With their
aid, he overthrew his foes in a fierce battle near the river Trent;
and then he passed with them into their own lands and helped
them drive out their enemies. So there was ever great friendship
between Arthur and the Kings Ban and Bors, and all their kindred;
and afterwards some of the most famous Knights of the
Round Table were <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref252">of that kin</a>.</p>

<p>Then King Arthur set himself to restore order throughout his
kingdom. To all who would submit and amend their evil ways,
he showed kindness; but those who <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref253">persisted in oppression</a> and
wrong he removed, putting in their places others who would deal
justly with the people. And because the land had become overrun
with forest during the <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref254">days of misrule</a>, he cut roads through
the thickets, that no longer wild beasts and men, fiercer than the
beasts, should lurk in their gloom, to the harm of the weak and
defenseless. Thus it came to pass that soon the peasant plowed
his fields in safety, and where had been wastes, men dwelt again
in peace and prosperity.</p>

<p>Amongst the lesser kings whom Arthur helped to rebuild their
towns and restore order was King Leodogran, of Cameliard.
Now Leodogran had one fair child, his daughter Guinevere; and
from the time that first he saw her, Arthur gave her all his love.
So he sought counsel of Merlin, his chief adviser. Merlin heard
the King sorrowfully, and said:</p>

<p>“Sir King, when a man’s heart is set, he may not change. Yet
had it been well if ye had loved another.”</p>

<p>So the King sent his knights to Leodogran to ask of him his
daughter; and Leodogran consented, rejoicing to wed her to so
good and knightly a king. With great pomp, the princess was
conducted to Canterbury, and there the King met her, and they
two were wed by the Archbishop in the great cathedral, amid the
rejoicings of the people.</p>

<p>On that same day did Arthur found his Order of the Round
Table, the fame of which was to spread throughout Christendom
and endure through all time. Now the Round Table had been
made for King Uther Pendragon by Merlin, who had meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
thereby to set forth plainly to all men the roundness of the earth.
After Uther died, King Leodogran had possessed it; but when
Arthur was wed, he sent it to him as a gift, and great was the
King’s joy at receiving it. One hundred fifty knights might
take their places about it, and for them Merlin made sieges, or
seats. One hundred twenty-eight did Arthur knight at that
great feast; thereafter, if any sieges were empty, at the high festival
of Pentecost new knights were ordained to fill them, and by
magic was the name of each knight found inscribed, in letters of
gold, in his proper siege. One seat only long remained unoccupied,
and that was the Siege Perilous. No knight might occupy
it until the coming of Sir Galahad; for, without danger to his life,
none might sit there who was not free from all stain of sin.</p>

<p><a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref255">With pomp and ceremony</a> did each knight take upon him the
vows of true knighthood: <em>to obey the King; to show mercy to all
who asked it; to defend the weak; and for no worldly gain to
fight in a wrongful cause;</em> and all the knights rejoiced together,
doing honor to Arthur and to his Queen. And all <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref256">men of worship</a>
said it was merry to be under such a chieftain, that would <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref257">put his
person in adventure</a> as other poor knights did. Then they rode
forth to right the wrong and help the oppressed, and by their aid,
the King held his realm in peace, doing justice to all.</p>

<h6>OF THE FINDING OF EXCALIBUR</h6>

<p>Now when Arthur was first made king, as young knights will,
he <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref258">courted peril</a> for its own sake, and often would he ride unattended
by lonely forest ways, seeking the adventure that chance
might send him. All unmindful was he of the ruin to his realm
if mischief befell him; and even his trusty counselors, though
they grieved that he should thus imperil him, yet could not but
love him the more for his hardihood.</p>

<p>So, on a day, he rode through the Forest Perilous where dwelt
the Lady Annoure, a sorceress of great might, who used her magic
powers but for the furtherance of her own desires. And as she
looked from a turret window, she descried King Arthur come
riding down a forest glade, and the sunbeams falling upon him
made one glory of his armor and of his yellow hair. Then, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Annoure gazed upon the King, she resolved that, come what might,
she would have him for her own, to dwell with her always and
<a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref259">fulfill all her behests</a>. And so she bade her men to lower the drawbridge
and <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref260">raise the portcullis</a>, and sallying forth accompanied by
her maidens, she gave King Arthur <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref261">courteous salutation</a>, and
prayed him that he would rest within her castle that day, for that
she had a petition to make to him; and Arthur, doubting nothing of
her good faith, suffered himself to be led within.</p>

<p>Then was a great feast spread, and Annoure caused the King
to be seated in a chair of state at her right hand, while squires
and pages served him on bended knee. So when they had feasted,
the King turned to the Lady Annoure and said courteously:</p>

<p>“Lady, somewhat ye said of a request that ye would make.
If there be aught in which I may give pleasure to you, I pray
you let me know it, and I will serve you as knightly as
I may.”</p>

<p>“In truth,” said the lady, “there is that which I would <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref262">fain
entreat of you</a>, most noble knight; yet suffer, I beseech you, that
first I may show you somewhat of my castle and my estate, and
then will I <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref263">crave a boon of your chivalry</a>.”</p>

<p>Then the sorceress led King Arthur from room to room of her
castle, and ever each displayed greater store of beauty than the
last. In some the walls were hung with rich tapestries, in others
they gleamed with precious stones; and the King marveled what
might be the petition of one that was mistress of such wealth.
Lastly, Annoure brought the King out upon the battlements, and
as he gazed around him, he saw that since he had entered the
castle there had sprung up about it triple walls of defense that
shut out wholly the forest from view. Then turned he to Annoure,
and gravely said:</p>

<p>“Lady, greatly I marvel in what a simple knight may give
pleasure to one that is mistress of so wondrous a castle as ye
have shown me here; yet if there be aught in which I may render
you knightly service, right gladly would I hear it now, for I must
go forth upon my way to render service to those whose knight I
am sworn.”</p>

<p>“Nay, now, King Arthur,” answered the sorceress mockingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
“ye may not deceive me! for well I know you, and that all Britain
bows to your behest.”</p>

<p>“The more reason then that I should ride forth to right wrong
and succor them that, of their loyalty, <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref264">render true obedience</a> to
their lord.”</p>

<p>“Ye speak as a fool,” said the sorceress; “why should one that
may command be at the beck and call of every hind and slave
within his realm? Nay, rest thee here with me, and I will make
thee ruler of a richer land than Britain, and satisfy thy every
desire.”</p>

<p>“Lady,” said the King sternly, “I will hear and judge of your
petition here and now, and then will I go forth upon my way.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Annoure, “there needs not this harshness. I did
but speak for thine advantage. Only vow thee to my service, and
there is naught that thou canst desire that thou shalt not possess.
Thou shalt be lord of this fair castle and of the mighty powers
that obey me. Why waste thy youth in hardship and in the
service of such as shall render thee little enough again?”</p>

<p>Thereupon, without ever a word, the King turned him about
and made for the turret stair by which he had ascended, but
nowhere could he find it. Then said the sorceress, mocking
him:</p>

<p>“Fair sir, how think ye to escape without my goodwill? See
ye not the walls that guard my stronghold? And think ye that
I have not servants enough to do my bidding?”</p>

<p>She clapped her hands and forthwith there appeared a company
of squires who, at her command, seized the King and bore
him away to a strong chamber where they locked him in.</p>

<p>And so the King abode that night, the prisoner of that evil
sorceress, with little hope that day, when it dawned, should bring
him better cheer. Yet lost he not courage, but kept watch and
vigil the night through, lest the powers of evil should assail him
unawares. And with the early morning light, Annoure came to
visit him. More stately she seemed than the night before, more
tall and more terrible; and her dress was one blaze of flashing
gems so that scarce could the eye look upon her. As a queen
might address a vassal, so greeted she the King, and as condescending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to one of low estate, asked how he had fared that night.
And the King made answer:</p>

<p>“I have <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref265">kept vigil</a> as behooves a knight who, knowing himself
to be in the midst of danger, would <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref266">bear himself meetly</a> in any
peril that should offer.”</p>

<p>And the Lady Annoure, admiring his knightly courage, desired
more earnestly even than before to win him to her will, and
she said:</p>

<p>“Sir Arthur, I know well your courage and knightly fame, and
greatly do I desire to keep you with me. Stay with me and I
promise that ye shall <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref267">bear sway</a> over a wider realm than any
that ye ever heard of, and I, even I, its mistress, will be at your
command. And what lose ye if ye accept my offer? Little
enough; for never think that ye shall win the world from evil, and
men to loyalty and truth.”</p>

<p>Then answered the King in anger: “Full well I see that thou
art <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref268">in league with evil</a> and that thou but seekest to turn me from
my purpose. I defy thee, foul sorceress. Do thy worst; though
thou slay me, thou shalt never sway me to thy will”; and therewith,
the King raised his cross-hilted sword before her. Then
the lady quailed at that sight. Her heart was filled with hate,
but she said:</p>

<p>“Go your way, proud King of a <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref269">petty realm</a>. Rule well your
race of miserable mortals, since it pleases you more than to bear
sway over the powers of the air. I keep you not against your
will.”</p>

<p>With these words she passed from the chamber, and the King
heard her give command to her squires to set him without her
gates, give him his horse, and suffer him to go on his way.</p>

<p>And so it came to pass that the King found himself once more
at large, and marveled to have won so lightly to liberty. Yet
knew he not the depths of treachery in the heart of Annoure; for
when she found she might not prevail with the King, she bethought
her how, <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref270">by mortal means</a>, she might bring him to
dishonor and death. And so, by her magic art, she caused the
King to follow a path that brought him to a fountain, whereby a
knight had his tent, and, for the love of adventure, held the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
against all comers. Now this knight was Sir Pellinore, and at
that time he had not his equal for strength and knightly skill,
nor had any been found that might stand against him. So, as
the King drew nigh, Pellinore cried:</p>

<p>“Stay, knight, for no one passes this way except he joust with
me.”</p>

<p>“That is not a good custom,” said the King; “and it were well
that ye followed it no more.”</p>

<p>“It is my custom, and I will follow it still,” answered Pellinore;
“if ye like it not, amend it if ye can.”</p>

<p>“I will <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref271">do my endeavor</a>,” said Arthur, “but, as ye see, I have
no spear.”</p>

<p>“Nay, I seek not <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref272">to have you at disadvantage</a>,” replied Pellinore,
and bade his squire give Arthur a spear. Then they <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref273">dressed
their shields</a>, laid their lances in rest, and rushed upon each other.
Now the King was wearied by his night’s vigil, and the strength
of Pellinore was as the strength of three men; so, at the first
encounter, Arthur was unhorsed. Then said he:</p>

<p>“I have lost the honor on horseback, but now will I encounter
thee with my sword and on foot.”</p>

<p>“I, too, will alight,” said Pellinore; “small honor to me were
it if I slew thee on foot, I being horsed the while.” So they
encountered each other on foot, and so fiercely they fought that
they hewed off great pieces of each other’s armor, and the ground
was dyed with their blood. But at the last, Arthur’s sword broke
off short at the hilt, and so he stood all defenseless before his foe.</p>

<p>“I have thee now,” cried Pellinore; “<a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref274">yield thee as recreant</a> or
I will slay thee.”</p>

<p>“That will I never,” said the King; “slay me if thou canst.”</p>

<p>Then he sprang on Pellinore, caught him by the middle, and
flung him to the ground, himself falling with him. And Sir Pellinore
marveled, for never before had he encountered so bold and
resolute a foe; but exerting his great strength, he rolled himself
over, and so brought Arthur beneath him. Then Arthur would
have perished, but at that moment Merlin stood beside him, and
when Sir Pellinore would have struck off the King’s head, stayed
his blow, crying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pellinore, if thou slayest this knight, thou puttest the whole
realm in peril; for this is none other than King Arthur himself.”</p>

<p>Then was Pellinore filled with dread, and cried:</p>

<p>“Better make an end of him at once; for if I suffer him to
live, what hope have I of his grace, that have dealt with him so
sorely?”</p>

<p>But before Pellinore could strike, Merlin caused a deep sleep
to come upon him; and raising King Arthur from the ground, he
<a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref275">stanched his wounds</a> and recovered him of his swoon.</p>

<p>But when the King came to himself, he saw his foe lie, still as
in death, on the ground beside him; and he was grieved, and said:</p>

<p>“Merlin, what have ye done to this brave knight? Nay, if ye
have slain him, I shall grieve my life long; for a good knight he
is, bold and a fair fighter, though something wanting in knightly
courtesy.”</p>

<p>“He is in better case than ye are, Sir King, who so lightly
imperil your person, and thereby your kingdom’s welfare; and, as
ye say, Pellinore is a stout knight, and hereafter shall he serve
you well. Have no fear. He shall wake again in three hours and
have suffered naught by the encounter. But for you, it were well
that ye came where ye might be tended for your wounds.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied the King, smiling, “I may not return to my
court thus weaponless; first will I find means to possess me of a
sword.”</p>

<p>“That is easily done,” answered Merlin; “follow me, and I
will bring you where ye shall get you a sword, the wonder of the
world.”</p>

<p>So, though his wounds pained him sore, the King followed
Merlin by many a forest path and glade, until they came upon
a mere, bosomed deep in the forest; and as he looked thereon, the
King beheld an arm, clothed in white samite, above the surface
of the lake, and in the hand was a fair sword that gleamed in
the level rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>“This is a great marvel,” said the King, “what may it mean?”</p>

<p>And Merlin made answer: “Deep is this mere, so deep indeed
that no man may fathom it; but in its depths, and built upon
the roots of the mountains, is the palace of the Lady of the Lake.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Powerful is she with a power that works ever for good, and she
shall help thee in thine hour of need.”</p>

<p>Anon the damsel herself came unto Arthur and said: “Sir
Arthur, King, yonder sword is mine and if ye will give me a gift
when I ask it of you, ye shall have it.”</p>

<p>“By my faith,” said Arthur, “I will give you what ye will ask.”</p>

<p>Then was Arthur aware of a little skiff, half hidden among
the bulrushes that fringed the lake; and leaping into the boat,
without aid of oar, he was wafted out into the middle of the lake,
to the place where, out of the water, rose the arm and sword.
And leaning from the skiff, he took the sword from the hand,
which forthwith vanished, and immediately thereafter the skiff
bore him back to land.</p>

<p>Arthur drew from its scabbard the mighty sword, wondering
at the marvel of its workmanship, for the hilt shone with the
elfin light of twinkling gems—diamond and topaz and emerald,
and many another whose name none knows. And as he looked
on the blade, Arthur was aware of mystic writings on the one side
and the other, and calling to Merlin, he bade him interpret them.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Merlin, “on the one side is written ‘Keep me,’ and
on the other ‘Throw me away.’”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the King, “which does it behoove me to do?”</p>

<p>“Keep it,” answered Merlin; “the time to cast it away is not
yet come. This is the <a href="#phrases28" title="List of phrases" id="ref276">good brand Excalibur</a>, or Cut Steel, and
well shall it serve you. But what think ye of the scabbard?”</p>

<p>“A fair cover for so good a sword,” answered Arthur.</p>

<p>“Nay, it is more than that,” said Merlin, “for so long as ye
keep it, though ye be wounded never so sore, yet ye shall not bleed
to death.” And when he heard that, the King marveled the more.</p>

<p>Then they journeyed back to Caerleon, where the knights
made great joy of the return of their lord. And presently, thither
came Sir Pellinore, craving pardon of the King, who made but
jest of his own misadventure. And afterwards Sir Pellinore became
of the Round Table, a knight vowed, not only to deeds of
hardihood, but also to gentleness and courtesy; and faithfully he
served the King, fighting ever to maintain justice and put down
wrong, and to defend the weak from the oppressor.</p>

<h6>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h6>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> The ancient Britons looked out from their little
island home with its protecting seas, and pictured the great unknown world
beyond as a fairyland filled with enchanted cities and wonderful forests, and
peopled by friendly fairies and magicians. About the beginning of our
Christian era the Romans came among them for a time, teaching them
obedience to law. Later, the barbarian hordes came over the North Sea,
to conquer them. But the invaders were resisted by strong leaders among
whom one by the name of Arthur stands pre-eminent. Historians generally
agree that a chieftain of this name actually lived about the close of the fifth
century or the beginning of the sixth. Some say he was from the north, some
from the south, of England. Arthur became not only the great national
hero, but also the champion of Christianity against heathen invaders. He
is said to have united the scattered British clans and to have defeated the
invaders in twelve great battles.</p>

<p>In their days of distress many of the Britons fled across the Channel
and settled among their kindred, the Bretons of northern France. From
here Welsh bards with their harps wandered throughout all Christendom,
singing of Arthur’s heroic deeds. As time went on these tales of Arthur
became blended with the fairy stories of their old happy dream-life. When
chivalry was at its height, from the twelfth to the fifteenth century, the
strolling minstrels took up the legend, adapting it to the ideals of the times
and to the tastes of their audiences in court and castle and market place.</p>

<p>In these songs and legends, Arthur appeared as a great king surrounded
at his “Table Round” with valiant knights who, under vows of purity and
holiness, went forth in daily quest of noble deeds. Early in the twelfth
century the legends were carried back to England. A Welsh priest, Geoffrey
of Monmouth, gave a form to these tales which became widely popular,
and later from this version and others, Sir Thomas Malory wrote his story,
“Le Morte D’Arthur” (The Death of Arthur). In 1485, William Caxton,
the first English printer, published Sir Thomas’s story, which became the
chief source of modern poets who have written on this theme. Among
these, the English poet, Tennyson, in his beautiful “Idylls of the King,”
has told the story of Arthur and his knights.</p>

<p>Britain at the time in which Arthur is supposed to have lived was a
land of warring tribes. Christianity had gained little more than a foothold.
It was an age in which might was greater than right. But when Arthur’s
knights went forth at the command of their king, their aim was to overthrow
the injustice and lawlessness then so common in the land. Wonderful
deeds were done by that little company of brave men, who rode abroad
“redressing wrongs.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Story of Gareth</span></h5>

<h6>HOW BEAUMAINS CAME TO KING ARTHUR’S COURT</h6>

<p>King Arthur had a custom that at the feast of Pentecost he
would not go to meat until he had heard or seen a great marvel.
And because of that custom all manner of strange adventures
came before him at that feast.</p>

<p>So Sir Gawain, a little before noon of the day of Pentecost,
saw from a window three men on horseback and a dwarf on foot,
and one of the men was higher than the other two, by a foot and
a half. Then Sir Gawain went unto the King and said, “Sir, go
to your meat, for here at hand come strange adventures.”</p>

<p>Right so came into the hall two men and upon their shoulders
there leaned the goodliest young man and the fairest that ever
they all saw, and he was tall and large and broad in the shoulders
and the fairest and largest-handed that ever man saw.</p>

<p>This young man said, “King Arthur, God bless you and all
your fair fellowship. For this cause I am come hither, to pray
you to give me three gifts and they shall not be unreasonably
asked, but you may honorably grant them me. The first gift I
will ask now and the other two I will ask this day twelvemonth.”</p>

<p>“Now ask,” said Arthur, “and ye shall have your asking.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the young man, “this is my petition, that ye will
give me meat and drink for this twelvemonth, and at that day I
will ask mine other two gifts.”</p>

<p>“My fair son,” said Arthur, “ask better, I counsel thee, for
this is but simple asking; for my heart tells me that thou shalt
prove a man of right great honor.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the young man, “be that as it may, I have asked
that I will ask.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the King, “ye shall have meat and drink enough;
I never refused that to friend or foe. But what is thy name?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“That is strange,” said the King, “that thou knowest not thy
name and thou art the goodliest young man that ever I saw.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the King charged Sir Kay, the steward, that he should
give the young man meat and drink of the best as though he
were a lord’s son.</p>

<p>“There is no need of that,” said Sir Kay, “for I am sure he is
of lowly birth. If he had come of gentlemen he would have asked
of you horse and armor, but such as he is, so he asketh. And as
he hath no name I shall name him Beaumains, that is Fair-hands,
and into the kitchen I shall take him.”</p>

<p>Then was Sir Gawain wroth and Sir Lancelot bade Sir Kay
stop his mocking of the young man. But Sir Kay bade the young
man sit down to meat with the boys of the kitchen and there he
ate sadly. And then Sir Lancelot bade him come to his chamber
and there he should have meat and drink enough. And this Sir
Lancelot did of his great gentleness and courtesy. And Sir
Gawain proffered him meat and drink, but he refused them both
and thus he was put into the kitchen.</p>

<p>So he endured all that twelvemonth and never displeased man
nor child, but always he was meek and kindly. But ever when
there was any jousting of knights, that would he see if he might.</p>

<p>So it passed on till the feast of Pentecost. On that day there
came a damsel into the hall and saluted the King and prayed for
succor for her lady who was besieged in her castle.</p>

<p>“Who is your lady and what is his name who hath besieged
her?” asked the King.</p>

<p>“Sir King,” she said, “my lady’s name shall ye not know from
me at this time, but the tyrant that besiegeth her and destroyeth
her lands is called the Red Knight of the Red Lands.”</p>

<p>“I know him not,” said the King.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Sir Gawain, “I know him well; men say that he
hath seven men’s strength and from him I escaped once full hard
with my life.”</p>

<p>“Fair damsel,” said the King, “there be knights here would do
their power to rescue your lady, but because you will not tell her
name, none of my knights shall go with you by my will.”</p>

<p>Then Beaumains came before the King and said, “Sir King,
I have been this twelvemonth in your kitchen and now I will ask
my two gifts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ask,” said the King, “and right gladly will I grant them.”</p>

<p>“Sir, these shall be my two gifts, first that ye will grant me
to have this adventure.”</p>

<p>“Thou shalt have it,” said the King.</p>

<p>“Then, sir, this is the other gift, that ye shall bid Sir Lancelot
to make me knight. And I pray you let him ride after me and
make me knight when I ask him.”</p>

<p>“All this shall be done,” said the King.</p>

<p>“Fie on thee,” said the damsel, “shall I have none but one
that is your kitchen boy?”</p>

<p>Then was she wroth and took her horse and departed from
him.</p>

<p>And with that there came one to Beaumains and told him his
horse and armor were come and there was the dwarf ready with all
things that he needed in the richest manner. So when he was
armed there were few so goodly men as he was.</p>

<p>Then Sir Kay said all open in the hall, “I will ride after my
boy of the kitchen, to see whether he will know me for his better.”
And as Beaumains overtook the damsel, right so came Sir Kay
and said, “Beaumains, what, sir, know ye not me?”</p>

<p>“Yea,” said Beaumains, “I know you for an <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref277">ungentle knight</a>
of the court and therefore beware of me.”</p>

<p>Therewith Sir Kay put his spear in the rest and ran straight
upon him, and Beaumains came as fast upon him with his sword
and thrust him through the side, so that Sir Kay fell down as if
he were dead and Beaumains took Sir Kay’s shield and spear and
rode on his way.</p>

<p>When Sir Lancelot overtook him he proffered Sir Lancelot to
joust and they came together fiercely and fought for an hour, and
Lancelot marveled at Beaumains’ strength, for he fought more like
a giant than a knight. So Sir Lancelot said, “Beaumains, <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref278">fight
not so sore</a>; your quarrel and mine is not so great but we may
leave off.”</p>

<p>“Truly that is truth,” said Beaumains, “but it doth me good
to feel your might.”</p>

<p>“Hope ye that I may any while stand a proved knight?” said
Beaumains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yea,” said Lancelot, “do as ye have done and I shall be <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref279">your
warrant</a>.”</p>

<p>“Then I pray you,” said Beaumains, “give me the order of
knighthood.”</p>

<p>“Then must ye tell me your name,” said Lancelot.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said, “my name is Gareth, and I am brother unto
Sir Gawain.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir,” said Lancelot, “I am more glad of you than I was,
for ever methought ye should be of great blood and that ye came
not to the court for meat or drink.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Lancelot gave him the order of knighthood and
departed from him and came to Sir Kay and made him to be
borne home upon his shield and he was healed of his wound.</p>

<p>But when Beaumains had overtaken the damsel, she said,
“What dost thou here? Thou smellest of the kitchen, thy clothes
be soiled with the grease and tallow that thou gainest in King
Arthur’s kitchen. Therefore, turn again, dirty kitchen boy; I
know thee well, for Sir Kay named thee Beaumains.”</p>

<p>“Damsel,” said Beaumains, “say to me what ye will, I will
not go from you, whatever ye say, for I have undertaken to King
Arthur for to <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref280">achieve your adventure</a> and so shall I finish it to
the end or I shall die therefor.”</p>

<p>So thus as they rode in the wood, there came a man flying all
that ever he might. “Whither wilt thou?” said Beaumains.</p>

<p>“O lord,” he said, “help me, for six thieves have taken my lord
and bound him, so I am afraid lest they will slay him.”</p>

<p>“Bring me thither,” said Beaumains.</p>

<p>And so they rode together until they came where the knight
was bound and then he rode unto the thieves and slew them all
and unbound the knight. And the knight thanked him and
prayed him to ride with him to his castle and he should reward
him for his good deeds.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Beaumains, “I will no reward have; I was this day
made knight of noble Sir Lancelot and therefore I will no reward
have but God reward me. Also I must follow this damsel.”</p>

<p>And when he came nigh her, she bade him ride from her. “For
thou smellest of the kitchen,” she said. Then the same knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
which was rescued rode after the damsel and prayed them to
lodge with him that night, and so that night they had good cheer
and rest.</p>

<p>And on the morrow the damsel and Beaumains rode on their
way until they came to a great forest. And there was a river
and but one passage and there were two knights to prevent their
crossing. “What sayest thou,” said the damsel, “wilt thou match
yonder knights or turn again?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Sir Beaumains, “I will not turn again if they were
six more.” And therewith he rushed into the water and they
drew their swords and smote at each other and Sir Beaumains
slew both the knights.</p>

<p>“Alas,” said the damsel, “that a kitchen boy should have the
fortune to destroy two such brave knights.”</p>

<p>“Damsel,” said Beaumains, “I care not what ye say, so that
I may rescue your lady.”</p>

<p>“If you follow me,” said the damsel, “thou art but slain, for
I see all that ever thou dost is but by misadventure and not by
might of thy hands.”</p>

<p>“Well, damsel, ye may say what ye will, but wheresoever ye
go, I will follow you.”</p>

<p>So Beaumains rode with that lady till evening and ever she
chid him and would not stop. And they came to a black plain
and there was a black hawthorne and thereon hung a black shield
and by it stood a black spear, great and long, and a great black
horse covered with silk.</p>

<h6>HOW BEAUMAINS FOUGHT WITH THE FOUR KNIGHTS</h6>

<p>There sat a knight all armed in black armor and his name
was the Knight of the Black Lands. And when the damsel came
nigh he said, “Damsel, have ye brought this knight of King
Arthur <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref281">to be your champion</a>?” “Nay, fair knight,” said she,
“this is but a kitchen boy that was fed in King Arthur’s kitchen
for alms.”</p>

<p>“Why cometh he,” said the knight, “<a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref282">in such array</a>? It is
shame that he beareth you company.”</p>

<p>“Sir, I cannot be delivered of him; through mishap I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
him slay two knights at the passage of the water and other deeds
he did before right marvelous and by chance.”</p>

<p>“I marvel,” said the Black Knight, “that any man that is of
honor will fight with him.”</p>

<p>“They know him not,” said the damsel.</p>

<p>“That may be,” said the knight, “but this much I shall grant
you; I shall put him down upon foot, and his horse and his armor
he shall leave with me, for it were shame to me to do him any
more harm.”</p>

<p>When Sir Beaumains heard him say thus, he said, “Sir Knight,
thou art full liberal of my horse and armor. I let thee know it
cost thee nought, and horse nor armor gettest thou none of mine
unless thou win them with thy hands.”</p>

<p>Then in great wrath they departed with their horses and came
together as it had been thunder. When they had fought for an
hour and a half the Black Knight fell down off his horse in swoon
and there he died. And Beaumains armed him in his armor and
took his horse and rode after the damsel.</p>

<p>When she saw him come nigh, she said, “Away, kitchen boy,
for the smell of thy clothes grieveth me. Alas, that a kitchen
boy should by mishap slay so good a knight as thou hast done.”</p>

<p>“I warn you, fair damsel,” said Beaumains, “that I will not
flee away nor leave your company for all that ye can say; therefore,
ride on your way, for follow you I will, whatsoever happen.”</p>

<p>Thus as they rode together they saw a knight come driving
by them all in green, both his horse and his armor, and when he
came nigh the damsel, he asked her, “Is that my brother, the
Black Knight, that ye have brought with you?”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” she said, “this kitchen boy hath slain your
brother.”</p>

<p>“Ah! traitor,” said the Green Knight, “thou shalt die for slaying
of my brother.”</p>

<p>“I defy thee,” said Beaumains, “for I <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref283">slew him knightly</a> and
not shamefully.”</p>

<p>And then they ran together with all their might and fought
a long while, and at last Beaumains gave the Green Knight such
a buffet upon the helmet that he fell upon his knees. And then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the Green Knight cried for mercy and prayed Sir Beaumains to
slay him not.</p>

<p>“Fair knight,” said the Green Knight, “save my life and I
will forgive thee the death of my brother and forever <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref284">be thy man</a>,
and thirty knights that follow me shall forever do you service.”</p>

<p>“Sir Knight,” said Beaumains, “all this availeth thee not unless
this damsel speak with me for thy life.” And therewith he made
a motion as if to slay him.</p>

<p>“Let be,” said the damsel, “slay him not, for if thou do thou
shalt repent it.”</p>

<p>Then Beaumains said, “Sir Knight, I release thee at this
damsel’s request.”</p>

<p>And then the Green Knight kneeled down and did him homage
with his sword, and he said, “Ye shall lodge with me this night
and tomorrow I shall help you through this forest.” So they
took their horses and rode to his manor.</p>

<p>And ever the damsel rebuked Beaumains and would not allow
him to sit at her table. “I marvel,” said the Green Knight, “why
ye rebuke this noble knight as ye do, for I warn you, damsel, he
is a full noble knight and I know no knight is able to match him,
therefore you do great wrong to rebuke him.”</p>

<p>And on the morrow they took their horses and rode on their
way and the Green Knight said, “My lord Beaumains, I and
these thirty knights shall be always at your summons both early
and late.”</p>

<p>“It is well said,” said Beaumains; “when I call upon you ye
must yield you unto King Arthur and all your knights.”</p>

<p>“If ye so command us, we shall be ready at all times,” said
the Green Knight. So then departed the Green Knight.</p>

<p>So within a while they saw a town as white as any snow and
the lord of the tower was in his castle and looked out at a window
and saw a damsel and a knight. So he armed him hastily. And
when he was on horseback, it was all red, both his horse and his
armor. And when he came nigh he thought it was his brother,
the Black Knight, and he cried aloud, “Brother, what do ye here?”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” said the damsel, “it is not he. This is but a
kitchen boy. He hath killed thy brother, the Black Knight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Also I saw thy brother, the Green Knight, overcome by him.
Now may ye be revenged on him.”</p>

<p>With this the knights came together with all their might and
fought furiously for two hours, so that it was wonder to see that
strong battle. Yet at the last, Sir Beaumains struck the Red
Knight to the earth. And the Red Knight cried mercy, saying,
“Noble knight, slay me not, and I shall yield me to thee with
sixty knights that be at my command. And I forgive thee all
thou hast done to me, and the death of my brother, the Black
Knight.”</p>

<p>“All this availeth not,” said Beaumains, “unless the damsel
pray me to save thy life.” And therewith he made a motion as if
to slay him.</p>

<p>“Let be,” said the damsel; “slay him not, for he is a noble
knight.”</p>

<p>Then Beaumains bade the Red Knight stand up and the Red
Knight prayed them to see his castle and rest there that night.
And upon the morn he came before Beaumains with his three
score knights and offered him his homage and service.</p>

<p>“I thank you,” said Beaumains, “but this ye shall grant me:
to come before my lord King Arthur and yield you unto him to
be his knight, when I call upon you.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the Red Knight, “I will be ready at your summons.”</p>

<p>So Sir Beaumains departed and the damsel, and ever she rode
chiding him.</p>

<p>“Damsel,” said Beaumains, “ye are <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref285">uncourteous to rebuke</a> me
as ye do, for I have done you good service.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said she, “right soon ye shall meet a knight who shall
pay thee all thy wages, for he is the greatest of the world, except
King Arthur.”</p>

<p>And soon there was before them a city rich and fair, and
between them and the city there was a fair meadow and therein
were many pavilions fair to behold.</p>

<p>“Lo,” said the damsel, “yonder is a lord that owneth yonder
city and his custom is when the weather is fair to joust in this
meadow. And ever there be about him five hundred knights and
gentlemen of arms.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“That goodly lord,” said Beaumains, “would I fain behold.”</p>

<p>“Thou shalt see him time enough,” said the damsel, and so as
she rode near she saw the pavilion where he was. “Lo,” said she,
“seest thou yonder pavilion that is all blue of color, and the lord’s
name is Sir Persant, the lordliest knight that ever thou lookedst
on?”</p>

<p>“It may well be,” said Beaumains, “but be he never so stout
a knight, in this field I shall abide until I see him.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, “I marvel what thou art; boldly thou speakest
and boldly thou hast done, that have I seen; therefore I pray thee
save thyself, for thou and thy horse are weary and here I dread
me sore lest ye catch some hurt. But I must tell you that Sir
Persant is nothing in might unto the knight that laid the siege
about my lady.”</p>

<p>“As for that,” said Sir Beaumains, “since I have come so nigh
this knight, I will prove his might before I depart from him.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the damsel, “I marvel what manner of man ye be,
for so shamefully did never woman treat knight as I have done
you and ever courteously ye have borne it. Alas, Sir Beaumains,
forgive me all that I have said or done against thee.”</p>

<p>“With all my heart,” said he, “I forgive you and now I think
there is no knight living, but I am able enough for him.”</p>

<p>When Sir Persant saw them in the field, he sent to them to
know whether Beaumains came in war or in peace.</p>

<p>“Say to thy lord,” said Beaumains, “that shall be as he
pleases.”</p>

<p>And so Sir Persant rode against him, and his armor and trappings
were blue, and Beaumains saw him and made him ready
and their horses rushed together and they fought two hours and
more. And at the last Beaumains smote Sir Persant that he fell
to the earth. Then Sir Persant yielded him and asked mercy.
With that came the damsel and prayed to save his life.</p>

<p>“I will gladly,” said Beaumains, “for it were pity this noble
knight should die.”</p>

<p>“Now this shall I do to please you,” said Sir Persant, “ye
shall have homage of me and an hundred knights to be always
at your command.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>And so they went to Sir Persant’s pavilion to rest that night.</p>

<p>And so on the morn the damsel and Sir Beaumains took their
leave.</p>

<p>“Fair damsel,” said Sir Persant, “whither are ye leading this
knight?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, “this knight is going to rescue my sister, Dame
Liones, who is besieged in the Castle Perilous.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Sir Persant, “she is besieged by the Red Knight
of the Red Lands, a man that is without mercy, and men say
that he hath seven men’s strength. He hath been well nigh two
years at this siege and he prolongeth the time, hoping to have
Sir Lancelot to do battle with him, or Sir Tristam, or Sir Lamorak,
or Sir Gawain.”</p>

<p>“My lord, Sir Persant,” said the damsel, “I require that ye
will make this gentleman knight before he fight the Red Knight.”</p>

<p>“I will with all my heart,” said Sir Persant, “if it please him
to take the order of knighthood from so simple a man as I am.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Beaumains, “I thank you for your goodwill, but the
noble knight Sir Lancelot made me knight.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Sir Persant, “of a more renowned knight might ye
not be made knight, for of all knights he may be called chief of
knighthood; and so all the world saith that betwixt three knights
is knighthood divided, Sir Lancelot, Sir Tristam, and Sir Lamorak.
Therefore, God speed ye well, for if ye conquer the Red Knight,
ye shall be called the fourth of the world.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Beaumains, “I would fain be of good fame and
knighthood and I will tell you both who I am. Truly then, my
name is Gareth of Orkney, and King Lot was my father, and my
mother is King Arthur’s sister, and Sir Gawain is my brother and
so Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris, and I am youngest of them all:
And yet know not King Arthur nor Sir Gawain who I am.”</p>

<h6>HOW THE LADY THAT WAS BESIEGED HAD WORD
FROM HER SISTER</h6>

<p>The lady that was besieged had word of her sister’s coming
by the dwarf, and also how the knight had passed all the perilous
passages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Dwarf,” said the lady, “I am glad of these things. Go thou
unto my sister and greet her well and commend me unto that
gentle knight and pray him to eat and to drink and make him
strong, and say ye that I thank him for his courtesy and goodness.”</p>

<p>So the dwarf departed and told Sir Beaumains all as ye have
heard and returned to the castle again. And there met him the
Red Knight of the Red Lands and asked him where he had
been.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the dwarf, “I have been with my lady’s sister of
this castle, and she hath been at King Arthur’s court and brought
a knight with her.”</p>

<p>“Then I count her labor but lost, for though she had brought
with her Sir Lancelot, Sir Tristam, Sir Lamorak, or Sir Gawain,
I would think myself good enough for them all.”</p>

<p>“It may well be,” said the dwarf, “but this knight hath passed
all the perilous passages and slain the Black Knight and won the
Green Knight, the Red Knight, and the Blue Knight.”</p>

<p>“Then is he one of the four that I have named.”</p>

<p>“He is none of those,” said the dwarf.</p>

<p>“What is his name?” said the Red Knight.</p>

<p>“That will I not tell you,” said the dwarf.</p>

<p>“I care not,” said the Red Knight, “what knight soever he
be, he shall have a shameful death as many others have had.”</p>

<p>And then Beaumains and the damsel came to a plain and saw
many tents and a fair castle and there was much smoke and great
noise and as they came near they saw upon great trees there
hung nigh forty goodly armed knights.</p>

<p>“Fair sir,” said the damsel, “all these knights came to this
siege to rescue my sister, and when the Red Knight of the Red
Lands had overcome them, he put them to this shameful death
without mercy or pity.”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said Beaumains, “he useth shameful customs and it
is marvel that none of the noble knights of my lord Arthur have
dealt with him.”</p>

<p>And there was near by a sycamore tree and there hung a horn
and this Red Knight had hanged it up there, that if there came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
any <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref286">errant knight</a> he must blow that horn and then he would make
him ready and come to him to do battle.</p>

<p>“Sir, I pray you,” said the damsel, “blow ye not the horn till
it be high noon, for his strength increaseth until noon, and at this
time men say he hath seven men’s strength.”</p>

<p>“Ah, for shame, fair damsel, say ye so never more to me, for
I will win honorably, or die knightly in the field.”</p>

<p>Therewith he blew the horn so eagerly that the castle rang
with the sound.</p>

<p>Then the Red Knight armed him hastily and all was blood red,
his armor, spear, and shield.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the damsel, “yonder is your deadly enemy and at
yonder window is my sister.”</p>

<p>With that the Red Knight of the Red Lands called to Sir
Beaumains, “Sir knight, I warn thee that for this lady I have done
many strong battles.”</p>

<p>“If thou have so done,” said Beaumains, “it was but waste
labor, and know, thou Red Knight of the Red Lands, I will rescue
her or die.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Beaumains bade the damsel go from him, and then
they put their spears in their rests and came together with all
their might.</p>

<p>Then they fought till it was past noon and when they had
rested a while they returned to the battle till evening, but at last
Sir Beaumains smote the sword out of the Red Knight’s hand and
smote him on the helmet, so that he fell to the earth.</p>

<p>Then the Red Knight said in a loud voice, “O noble knight, I
yield me to thy mercy.”</p>

<p>But Sir Beaumains said, “I may not with honor save thy life,
for the shameful deaths thou hast caused many good knights
to die.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the Red Knight, “hold your hand and ye shall
know the causes why I put them to so shameful a death.”</p>

<p>“Say on,” said Sir Beaumains.</p>

<p>“Sir, a lady prayed me that I would make her a promise by
the faith of my knighthood that I would labor daily in arms, until
I met Sir Lancelot or Sir Gawain, who, she said, had slain her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
brother, and this is the cause that I have put all these knights
to death. And now I will tell thee that every day my strength
increaseth till noon and all this time have I seven men’s strength.”</p>

<p>Then there came many earls and barons and noble knights
and prayed Sir Beaumains to save his life.</p>

<p>“Sir,” they said, “it were fairer to take homage and let him
hold his lands of you than to slay him; by his death ye shall have
no advantage, and his misdeeds that be done may not be undone,
and therefore he shall <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref287">make amends</a> to all parties and we all will
become your men and do you homage.”</p>

<p>“Fair lords” said Beaumains, “I am loath to slay this knight;
nevertheless he hath done shamefully, but insomuch all that he
did was at a lady’s request, I will release him upon this condition,
that he go within the castle and yield him to the lady, and if she
will forgive him, I will. And also when that is done, that ye go
unto the court of King Arthur and there that you ask Sir Lancelot
mercy and Sir Gawain, for the evil will ye have had against
them.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the Red Knight, “all this will I do as ye command.”</p>

<p>And so within a while the Red Knight went into the castle
and promised to make amends for all that had been done against
the lady. And then he departed unto the court of King Arthur
and told openly how he was overcome and by whom.</p>

<p>Then said King Arthur and Sir Gawain, “We marvel much
of what blood he is come, for he is a noble knight.”</p>

<p>“He is come of full noble blood,” said Sir Lancelot, “and as
for his might and hardiness, there be but few now living so
mighty as he is.”</p>

<h6>HOW AT THE FEAST OF PENTECOST ALL THE KNIGHTS THAT SIR
GARETH HAD OVERCOME CAME AND YIELDED
THEM TO KING ARTHUR</h6>

<p>So leave we Sir Beaumains and turn we unto King Arthur,
that at the next feast of Pentecost held his feast, and there came
the Green Knight with thirty knights and yielded them all unto
King Arthur. And so there came the Red Knight, his brother,
and yielded him unto King Arthur and threescore knights with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
him. Also there came the Blue Knight, brother to them, with an
hundred knights and yielded them unto King Arthur.</p>

<p>These three brethren told King Arthur how they were overcome
by a knight that a damsel had with her and called him
Beaumains.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said the King, “what knight he is and of what
lineage he is come.”</p>

<p>So, right as the King stood talking with these three brothers,
there came Sir Lancelot and told the King that there was come a
goodly lord and six hundred knights with him.</p>

<p>Then this lord saluted the King.</p>

<p>“Sir,” he said, “my name is the Red Knight of the Red Lands,
and here I am sent by a knight that is called Beaumains, for he
won me in battle hand for hand.”</p>

<p>“Ye are welcome,” said the King, “for ye have long been a
great foe to me and my court and now I trust to God I shall so
treat you that ye shall be my friend.”</p>

<p>“Sir, both I and these knights shall always be at your summons
to do you service.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall make thee a knight of the Table Round, but
thou must be no more a murderer.”</p>

<p>“Sir, as to that, I have promised Sir Beaumains never more
to use such customs and I must go unto Sir Lancelot and to Sir
Gawain and ask them forgiveness of the evil will I had unto
them.”</p>

<p>“They be here now,” said the King, “before thee; now may
ye say to them what ye will.”</p>

<p>And then he kneeled down unto Sir Lancelot and Sir Gawain
and prayed for forgiveness for the enmity that he had against
them.</p>

<h6>HOW THE QUEEN OF ORKNEY CAME TO THE FEAST</h6>

<p>So then they went to meat, and as they sat at the meat there
came in the Queen of Orkney with ladies and knights, a great
number. And then Sir Gawain, Sir Agravaine, and Sir Gaheris
arose and went to her and saluted her upon their knees and asked
her blessing, for in fifteen years they had not seen her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she spake to her brother, King Arthur, “Where is my
young son, Sir Gareth? He was here a twelvemonth, and ye
made a kitchen boy of him, which is shame to you all. Alas,
where is my dear son that was my joy and my bliss?”</p>

<p>“O dear mother,” said Sir Gawain, “I knew him not.” “Nor
I,” said the King, “but thank God he is proved an honorable
knight as any now living of his years, and I shall never be glad
until I find him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, brother,” said the Queen, “ye did yourself great shame
when you kept my son in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Fair sister,” said the King, “I knew him not, nor did Sir
Gawain. Also, sister, ye might have told me of his coming and
then, if I had not done well to him, ye might have blamed me.
For when he came to my court, he asked me three gifts and one
he asked the same day; that was, that I would give him meat
enough for that twelvemonth, and the other two gifts he asked
that day a twelvemonth and that was that he might have the
adventure for the damsel, and the third was that Sir Lancelot
should make him knight when he desired him. And so I granted
him all his desire.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said the Queen, “I sent him to you well armed and
horsed and gold and silver plenty to spend.”</p>

<p>“It may be,” said the King, “but thereof saw we none, save
the day he departed from us, knights told me that there came
a dwarf hither suddenly and brought him armor and a good
horse, and thereat we all had marvel from whence those riches
came.”</p>

<p>“Brother,” said the Queen, “all that ye say I believe, but I
marvel that Sir Kay did mock and scorn him and gave him that
so name Beaumains.”</p>

<p>“By the grace of God,” said Arthur, “he shall be found, so let
all this pass and be merry, for he is proved to be a man of honor
and that is my joy.”</p>

<p>Then said Sir Gawain and his brethren to Arthur, “Sir, if ye
will give us leave, we will go and seek our brother.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Sir Lancelot, “that shall ye not need, for by my
advice the King shall send unto Dame Liones a messenger and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
pray that she will come to the court in all the haste that she may
and then she may give you best counsel where to find him.”</p>

<p>“That is well said of you,” said the King.</p>

<p>So the messenger was sent forth and night and day he went
until he came to the Castle Perilous. And the lady was there
with her brother and Sir Gareth. When she understood the message
she went to her brother and Sir Gareth and told them how
King Arthur had sent for her.</p>

<p>“That is because of me,” said Sir Gareth. “I pray you do
not let them know where I am. I know my mother is there and
all my brethren and they will take upon them to seek me.”</p>

<p>So the lady departed and came to King Arthur, where she
was nobly received and there she was questioned by the King.
And she answered that she could not tell where Sir Gareth was.
But she said to Arthur, “Sir, I will have a <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref288">tournament proclaimed</a>
to take place before my castle and the proclamation shall be this:
that you, my lord Arthur, shall be there and your knights; and
I will provide that my knights shall be against yours and then
I am sure ye shall hear of Sir Gareth.”</p>

<p>“That is well advised,” said King Arthur, and so she departed.</p>

<p>When the Lady Liones returned to her home, she told what
she had done and the promise she had made to King Arthur.
Then Sir Gareth sent unto Sir Persant, the Blue Knight, and
summoned him and his knights. Then he sent unto the Red
Knight and charged him that he be ready with all his knights.</p>

<p>Then the Red Knight answered and said, “Sir Gareth, ye
shall understand that I have been at the court of King Arthur
and Sir Persant and his brethren and there we have done our
homage as ye commanded us. Also, I have taken upon me with
Sir Persant and his brethren to hold part against my lord, Sir
Lancelot and the knights of that court. And this have I done
for the love of you, my lord Sir Gareth.”</p>

<p>“Ye have well done,” said Sir Gareth, “but you must know
you shall be matched with the most noble knights of the world;
therefore we must provide us with good knights, wherever we
may get them.”</p>

<p>So the proclamation was made in England, Wales, Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Ireland, and in Brittany, that men should come to the Castle
Perilous and all the knights should have the choice whether to be
on the one party with the knights of the castle or on the other
party with King Arthur. And so there came many good knights
and chose to be on the side of the castle and against King Arthur
and his knights.</p>

<h6>HOW KING ARTHUR WENT TO THE TOURNAMENT</h6>

<p>And there came with King Arthur many kings, princes, earls,
barons, and other noble knights. Then Sir Gareth prayed Dame
Liones and the Red Knight and Sir Persant that none should tell
his name and that they should make no more of him than of the
least knight that was there.</p>

<p>Upon the day of the tournament the heralds sounded the
trumpets to call the knights to the field. After many noble
knights had encountered, Sir Gareth came upon the field. All the
knights that encountered him were overthrown.</p>

<p>“That knight is a good knight,” said King Arthur.</p>

<p>Wherefore the King called unto him Sir Lancelot and prayed
him <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref289">to encounter with that knight</a>.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Lancelot, “when a good knight doth so well upon
some day, it is no good knight’s part to prevent him from receiving
honor, and therefore, as for me, this day he shall have the
honor; though it lay in my power to hinder him, I would not.”</p>

<p>Then betwixt many knights there was strong battle, and marvelous
deeds of arms were done. And two knights, who were
brothers, assailed Sir Lancelot at once and he, as the noblest
knight of the world, fought with them both, so that all men wondered
at the nobility of Sir Lancelot. And then came in Sir
Gareth and knew that it was Sir Lancelot that fought with the
two strong knights. So Sir Gareth came with his good horse and
hurled them apart and no stroke would he smite to Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>Sir Lancelot saw this and thought it must be the good Knight
Sir Gareth and Sir Gareth rode here and there and smote on the
right hand and on the left hand, so that all men said he best did
his duty.</p>

<p>“Now go,” said King Arthur unto the heralds, “and ride about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
him and see what manner of knight he is, for I have inquired of
many knights this day that be of his party and all say they know
him not.”</p>

<p>And so a herald rode as near Sir Gareth as he could and there
he saw written upon his helmet in gold, “Sir Gareth of Orkney.”
Then the herald cried and many heralds with him, “This is Sir
Gareth of Orkney.” Then all the kings and knights pressed to
behold him and ever the heralds cried, “This is Sir Gareth of
Orkney, King Lot’s son.”</p>

<p>When Sir Gareth saw that he was known, then he doubled his
strokes and with great difficulty made his way out of the crowd,
and rode into the forest. And then fell there a thunder and rain
as though heaven and earth should go together.</p>

<p>Sir Gareth was not a little weary, for all that day he had but
little rest, neither his horse nor he, and he rode in the forest until
night came. And ever it lightened and thundered but at last by
fortune he came to a castle.</p>

<h6>HOW SIR GARETH CAME TO A CASTLE WHERE
HE WAS WELL LODGED</h6>

<p>Then Sir Gareth rode into the courtyard of the castle and
prayed the porter to let him in. The porter answered, “Thou
gettest no lodging here.”</p>

<p>“Fair sir, say not so, for I am a knight of King Arthur’s, and
pray the lord or the lady of this castle to give me lodging for the
love of King Arthur.”</p>

<p>Then the porter went unto the lady and told her there was a
knight of King Arthur’s would have lodging.</p>

<p>“Let him enter,” said the lady, “for King Arthur’s sake.”</p>

<p>Then she went up into a tower over the gate with great torchlight.
When Sir Gareth saw the light he cried aloud, “Whether
thou be lord or lady, giant or champion, I care not, so that I may
have lodging this night; and if it so be that I must fight, spare
me not tomorrow when I have rested, for both I and mine horse
be weary.”</p>

<p>“Sir Knight,” said the lady, “thou speakest knightly and
boldly, but the lord of this castle loveth not King Arthur nor his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
court, for my lord hath been ever against him and therefore thou
were better not to come within this castle, for if thou come in
this night, then wherever thou meet my lord, thou must yield
thee to him as prisoner.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Sir Gareth, “what is your lord’s name?”</p>

<p>“Sir, my lord’s name is the Duke de la Rowse.”</p>

<p>“Well, madam,” said Sir Gareth, “I shall promise you in whatever
place I meet your lord, I shall yield me unto him and to his
good grace, if I understand he will do me no harm; and if I understand
that he will, I will release myself if I can, with my spear
and my sword.”</p>

<p>“Ye say well,” said the lady, and then she let the drawbridge
down and he rode into the hall and there he alit, and his horse
was led into a stable. And in the hall he unarmed him and said,
“Madam, I will not go out of this hall this night, and when it is
daylight, whoever will fight me shall find me ready.”</p>

<p>Then was he set unto supper and had many good dishes, and so
when he had supped, he rested him all night. And on the morn
he took his leave and thanked the lady for her lodging and good
cheer and then she asked him his name.</p>

<p>“Madam,” he said, “truly my name is Gareth of Orkney and
some men call me Beaumains.”</p>

<p>So Sir Gareth departed and by fortune he came to a mountain
and there he found a goodly knight, who said, “Abide, sir
knight, and joust with me.”</p>

<p>“What are ye called?” said Sir Gareth.</p>

<p>“My name is the Duke de la Rowse.”</p>

<p>“Ah, sir, I lodged in your castle and there I made promise unto
your lady that I should yield me unto you.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the duke, “art thou that proud knight that offerest
to fight with my knights? Make thee ready, for I will fight
with you.”</p>

<p>So they did battle together more than an hour and at last Sir
Gareth smote the duke to earth and the duke yielded to him.</p>

<p>“Then must ye go,” said Sir Gareth, “unto King Arthur, my
lord, at the next feast and say that I, Sir Gareth of Orkney, sent
you unto him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“It shall be done,” said the duke, “and I will do homage to
you, and a hundred knights with me, and all the days of my life
do you service wherever you command me.”</p>

<h6>HOW SIR GARETH AND SIR GAWAIN FOUGHT
EACH AGAINST OTHER</h6>

<p>So the duke departed and Sir Gareth stood there alone and
then he saw an armed knight coming toward him. Then Sir
Gareth mounted upon his horse and they ran together as it had
been thunder. And so they fought two hours. At last came the
damsel, who rode with Sir Gareth so long, and she cried, “Sir
Gawain, Sir Gawain, leave thy fighting with thy brother Sir
Gareth.”</p>

<p>And when he heard her say so he threw away his shield and
his sword and ran to Sir Gareth and took him in his arms and
then kneeled down and asked for mercy.</p>

<p>“Who are ye,” said Sir Gareth, “that right now were so strong
and so mighty and now so suddenly yield you to me?”</p>

<p>“O Gareth, I am your brother, Gawain, that for your sake
have had great sorrow and labor.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Gareth unlaced his helmet and kneeled down to him
and asked for mercy. Then they rose and embraced each other
and wept a great while and either of them gave the other the prize
of the battle. And there were many kind words between them.</p>

<p>“Alas, my fair brother,” said Sir Gawain, “I ought of right to
honor you, if you were not my brother, for ye have honored King
Arthur and all his court, for ye have sent him more honorable
knights this twelvemonth than six of the best of the Round
Table have done except Sir Lancelot.”</p>

<p>Then the damsel went to King Arthur, who was but two miles
thence. And when she told him of Sir Gawain and Sir Gareth, the
King mounted a horse and bade the lords and ladies come after,
who that would, and there was saddling and bridling of queens’
horses and princes’ horses and well was he that was soonest ready.</p>

<p>And when the King came nigh Sir Gareth, he made great joy
and ever he wept as if he were a child. With that came Gareth’s
mother and when she saw Gareth she might not weep, but suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
fell down in a swoon and lay there a great while, as if she
were dead. And then Sir Gareth comforted his mother in such
wise that she recovered and made good cheer.</p>

<p>Then made Sir Lancelot great cheer of Sir Gareth and he of
him, for there was never knight that Sir Gareth loved so well as
he did Sir Lancelot, and ever for the most part he would be in
Sir Lancelot’s company.</p>

<p>And this Sir Gareth was a noble knight and a <a href="#phrases29" title="List of phrases" id="ref290">well-ruled and
fair-languaged</a>.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Peerless Knight Lancelot</span></h5>

<h6>THE TOURNAMENT AT WINCHESTER</h6>

<p>King Arthur proclaimed a great joust and a tournament that
should be held at Camelot, that is Winchester; and the King said
that he and the King of Scots would joust against all that would
come against them. And when this proclamation was made,
thither came many knights.</p>

<p>So King Arthur made him ready to depart to these jousts,
but Sir Lancelot would not ride with the King, for he said he
was suffering from a grievous wound. And so the King departed
toward Winchester <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref291">with his fellowship</a> and by the way he lodged
in a town called Astolat.</p>

<p>And upon the morn early Sir Lancelot departed and rode until
he came to Astolat and there it happened in the evening, he came
to the castle of an old baron, who was called Sir Bernard
of Astolat. As Sir Lancelot entered into his lodging, King Arthur
saw him and knew him full well.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said King Arthur unto the knights that were with
him. “I have now seen one knight that will play his play at the
jousts to which we are going. I <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref292">undertake he will do great
marvels</a>.”</p>

<p>“Who is that, we pray you tell us?” said many knights that
were there at that time.</p>

<p>“Ye shall not know from me,” said the King, “at this time.”</p>

<p>And so the King smiled and went to his lodging.</p>

<p>So when Sir Lancelot was in his lodging and unarmed him in
his chamber, the old baron came to him and welcomed him in the
best manner, but the old knight knew not Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>“Fair sir,” said Sir Lancelot to his host, “I would pray you
to lend me a shield that were not openly known, for mine is well
known.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said his host, “ye shall have your desire for meseemeth
ye be one of the <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref293">likeliest knights</a> of the world and therefore I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
show you friendship. Sir, I have two sons that were but late made
knights and the elder is called Sir Torre and he was hurt that same
day he was made knight, that he may not ride and his shield ye
shall have, for that is not known, I dare say, but here, and in no
place else. And my younger son is called Lavaine and if it please
you, he shall ride with you unto the jousts and he is of age and
strong and brave; for much <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref294">my heart giveth unto you</a> that ye be
a noble knight. Therefore, I pray you tell me your name,” said
Sir Bernard.</p>

<p>“As for that,” said Sir Lancelot, “ye must hold me excused at
this time and if God give me grace to speed well at the jousts, I
shall come again and tell you. But, I pray you, in any wise, let
me have your son, Sir Lavaine, with me and that I may have his
brother’s shield.”</p>

<p>“All this shall be done,” said Sir Bernard.</p>

<p>This old baron had a daughter that was called at that time
the fair maiden of Astolat and her name was Elaine. So this
maiden besought Sir Lancelot to wear upon him at the jousts a
token of hers.</p>

<p>“Fair damsel,” said Sir Lancelot, “if I grant you that, I will
do more for you than ever I did for lady.”</p>

<p>Then he remembered him he would go to the jousts disguised.
And because he had never before that time borne the token of any
lady, then he bethought him that he would wear one of hers, that
none of his blood thereby might know him. And then he said,
“Fair maiden, I will grant you to wear a token of yours upon mine
helmet and therefore what it is, show it me.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” she said, “it is a sleeve of mine, of scarlet, well embroidered
with great pearls.”</p>

<p>And so she brought it him. So Sir Lancelot received it and
gave the maiden his shield in keeping, and he prayed her to keep
that until he came again.</p>

<p>So upon a day, on the morn, King Arthur and all his knights
departed, for the King had tarried three days to abide his noble
knights. And so when the King had gone, Sir Lancelot and Sir
Lavaine made them ready to ride and either of them had white
shields, and the red sleeve Sir Lancelot carried with him. So they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
took their leave of Sir Bernard, the old baron, and of his daughter
the fair maiden of Astolat.</p>

<p>And then they rode till they came to Camelot and there was
a great press of kings, dukes, earls, and barons and many noble
knights. But there Sir Lancelot was lodged by means of Sir
Lavaine <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref295">with a rich burgess</a> so that no man in that town knew who
they were. And so they reposed them there, till the day of the
tournament.</p>

<p>So the trumpets blew unto the field and King Arthur was set
on a high place to behold who did best. Then some of the kings
were that time turned upon the side of King Arthur. And then
on the other party were the King of Northgalis and the King of
the Hundred Knights and the King of Northumberland and Sir
Galahad, the noble prince. But these three kings and this duke
were passing weak to hold against King Arthur’s party, for with
him were the noblest knights of the world.</p>

<p>So then they withdrew them, either party from other, and
every man made him ready in his best manner to do what he
might. Then Sir Lancelot made him ready and put the red sleeve
upon his head and fastened it fast; and so Sir Lancelot and Sir
Lavaine departed out of Winchester and rode into a little leaved
wood behind the party that held against King Arthur’s party, and
there they held them still till the parties smote together.</p>

<p>And then came in the King of Scots and the King of Ireland on
Arthur’s party and against them came the King of Northumberland,
and the King with the Hundred Knights smote down the
King of Ireland. So there began <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref296">a strong assail</a> upon both parties.
And there came in together many knights of the Table Round
and beat back the King of Northumberland and the King of
Northgalis.</p>

<p>When Sir Lancelot saw this, he said unto Sir Lavaine, “See,
yonder is a company of good knights and they hold them together
as boars that were chased with dogs.”</p>

<p>“That is truth,” said Sir Lavaine.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Sir Lancelot, “if ye will help me a little, ye shall
see yonder fellowship that chaseth now these men on our side, that
they shall go as fast backward as they went forward.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sir, spare not,” said Sir Lavaine, “for I shall do what I may.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Lancelot and Sir Lavaine came in at the thickest of
the press and there Sir Lancelot smote down five knights and all
this he did with one spear; and Sir Lavaine smote down two
knights. And then Sir Lancelot got another spear and there he
smote down four knights and Sir Lavaine smote one.</p>

<p>And then Sir Lancelot drew his sword and there he smote on the
right hand and on the left hand and by great force he unhorsed
three knights; and then the knights of the Table Round withdrew
them back, after they had gotten their horses as well as they
might.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Sir Gawain, “what knight is yonder that doth such,
marvelous deeds of arms in that field?”</p>

<p>“I know well who he is,” said King Arthur, “but at this time
I will not name him.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Sir Gawain, “I would say it were Sir Lancelot by
his riding and the blows I see him deal, but ever meseemeth it
should not be he, for that he beareth the red sleeve upon his head,
for I know he never wore token of lady at a joust.”</p>

<p>“Let him be,” said King Arthur; “he will be better known and
do more, or ever he depart.”</p>

<p>Then the party that was against King Arthur was well comforted
and then they held them together that beforehand were sore
pressed. So nine knights of Lancelot’s kin thrust in mightily, for
they were all noble knights; and they, of great hate that they
had unto him, thought to rebuke that noble knight, Sir Lancelot,
and Sir Lavaine, for they knew them not. And so they came
charging together and smote down many knights of Northgalis
and Northumberland.</p>

<p>And when Sir Lancelot saw them fare so, he took a spear in his
hand and there encountered with him all at once, Sir Bors, Sir
Ector, and Sir Lionel, and all they three smote him at once with
their spears.</p>

<p>And with force of themselves they smote Sir Lancelot’s horse
to the earth and by misfortune Sir Bors smote Sir Lancelot
through the shield into the side and the spear broke and the head
was left in his side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>When Sir Lavaine saw his master lie on the ground, he ran
to the King of Scots and smote him to the earth; and by great
force he took his horse and brought it to Sir Lancelot, and in
spite of them all he made him to mount upon that horse. And
then Sir Lancelot took a spear in his hand and there he smote Sir
Bors, horse and man, to the earth. In the same wise he served Sir
Ector and Sir Lionel.</p>

<p>And then Sir Lancelot drew his sword, for he felt himself so
sore and hurt that he thought there to have had his death. And
he smote down three knights more, but by this was Sir Bors horsed
and then he came with Sir Ector and Sir Lionel and all they three
smote with swords upon Sir Lancelot’s helmet. And when he felt
their buffets and his wound, which was so grievous, then he
thought to do what he might, while he might endure.</p>

<p>And then he gave Sir Bors such a buffet that he made him bow
his head passing low; and therewith he smote off his helmet and
might have slain him; and so pulled him down, and in the same
wise he served Sir Ector and Sir Lionel. For he might have slain
them, but when he saw their faces his heart <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref297">might not serve him
thereto</a>, but left them there.</p>

<p>And so afterward he hurled into the thickest press of them all
and did there the most marvelous deeds of arms that ever man
saw or heard speak of, and ever Sir Lavaine, the good knight, with
him. And there Sir Lancelot with his sword smote down and
pulled down more than thirty knights and the most part were of
the Table Round; and Sir Lavaine did full well that day, for he
smote down ten knights of the Table Round.</p>

<p>“I marvel,” said Sir Gawain, “what knight that is with the red
sleeve.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said King Arthur, “he will be known before he depart.”</p>

<p>And then the trumpets blew and the prize was given by heralds
unto the knight with the white shield that bore the red sleeve.
Then came the King with the Hundred Knights, the King of
Northgalis and the King of Northumberland and Sir Galahad, the
noble prince, and said unto Sir Lancelot, “Fair knight, God thee
bless, for much have you done this day for us; therefore, we pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
you that ye will come with us, that ye may receive the honor and
the prize, as ye have honorably deserved it.”</p>

<p>“My fair lords,” said Sir Lancelot, “if I have deserved thanks,
I have sore bought it; and that me repenteth, for I am like never
to escape with my life; therefore, fair lords, I pray you that ye
will <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref298">suffer me</a> to depart where me liketh, for I am sore hurt. I care
for no honor, for I would more gladly repose me than to be lord
of all the world.”</p>

<p>And therewithal he groaned piteously and rode away from
them until he came to a wood. And when he saw that he was from
the field nigh a mile, that he was sure he might not be seen, then
he said, “O gentle knight, Sir Lavaine, help me that this spear
were out of my side, for it slayeth me.”</p>

<p>“O mine own lord,” said Sir Lavaine, “I would fain do that
might please you, but I dread me sore, if I pull out the spear, that
ye shall be in peril of death.”</p>

<p>“I charge you,” said Sir Lancelot, “as ye love me, draw it out.”</p>

<p>And therewithal he descended from his horse and right so did
Sir Lavaine; and forthwith Sir Lavaine drew the spear out of his
side and he gave a great shriek and so swooned, pale and deadly.</p>

<p>“Alas,” said Sir Lavaine, “what shall I do?”</p>

<p>And so at the last Sir Lancelot cast up his eyes and said,
“O Lavaine, help me that I were on my horse, for here is fast by
within this two miles a gentle hermit, that sometime was a full
noble knight and a great lord of possessions. And for great goodness
he hath taken him to poverty and his name is Sir Baudwin of
Brittany and he is <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref299">a full noble surgeon</a>. Now let see, help me up
that I were there, for ever my heart telleth me that I shall never
die of my cousin’s hands.”</p>

<p>And then with great pain Sir Lavaine helped him upon his
horse. And then they rode together and so by fortune they came
to that hermitage, the which was in a wood and a great cliff on
the other side and fair water running under it. And Sir Lavaine
beat on the gate and there came a fair child to them and asked
them what they would.</p>

<p>“Fair son,” said Sir Lavaine, “go and pray thy lord, the hermit,
to let in here a knight that is full sore wounded; and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
day, tell thy lord, I saw him do more deeds of arms than ever I
heard say that any man did.”</p>

<p>So the child went in lightly and then he brought the hermit,
the which was a passing good man. When Sir Lavaine saw him,
he <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref300">prayed him for succor</a>.</p>

<p>“What knight is he?” said the hermit. “Is he of the house of
Arthur or not?”</p>

<p>“I know not,” said Sir Lavaine, “what is he or what is his
name, but well I know I saw him do marvelously this day, as of
deeds of arms.”</p>

<p>“On whose party was he?” said the hermit.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Lavaine, “he was this day against King Arthur
and there he won the prize from all the knights of the Round
Table.”</p>

<p>“I have seen the day,” said the hermit, “I would have loved
him the worse because he was against my lord, King Arthur, for
sometime I was one of the fellowship of the Round Table, but I
thank God, now I am otherwise disposed. But where is he?
Let me see him.”</p>

<p>And when the hermit beheld him, he thought that he should
know him, but he could not <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref301">bring him to knowledge</a> because he
was so pale.</p>

<p>“What knight are ye?” said the hermit.</p>

<p>“My fair lord,” said Lancelot, “I am a stranger and a knight
adventurous, that laboreth throughout many realms for to win
honor.”</p>

<p>Then the hermit saw by a wound on his cheek that he was
Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>“Alas,” said the hermit, “mine own lord, why conceal you
your name from me? Forsooth, I ought to know you of right,
for ye are the noblest knight of the world, for well I know you
for Sir Lancelot.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said he, “since ye know me, help me if ye can, for
I would be out of this pain at once, either to death or to
life.”</p>

<p>“Have ye no doubt,” said the hermit, “ye shall live and fare
right well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>And so the hermit called to him two of his servants and they
bore him into the hermitage and lightly unarmed him and laid him
in his bed. And then anon the hermit stanched his blood and soon
Sir Lancelot was well refreshed and knew himself.</p>

<p>Now turn we unto King Arthur and leave we Sir Lancelot in
the hermitage. So when the kings were come together on both
parties and the great feast should be held, King Arthur asked
the King of Northgalis and their fellowship, where was that
knight that bore the red sleeve.</p>

<p>“Bring him before me, that he may have his praise and honor
and the prize as it is right.”</p>

<p>Then spake Sir Galahad, the noble prince, “We suppose that
knight is injured and that he is never like to see you nor any of
us all, and that is the greatest pity that ever we knew of any
knight.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” said Arthur, “how may this be? Is he so hurt? What
is his name?”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said they all, “we know not his name, nor from
whence he came nor whither he went.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” said the King, “this be to me the worst tidings that
came to me this seven year, for I would not for all the lands I
possess to know that that noble knight were slain.”</p>

<p>“Know ye him?” said they all.</p>

<p>“As for that,” said Arthur, “whether I know him or not, ye
shall not know from me what man he is, but God send me good
tidings of him.”</p>

<p>“If it so be that the good knight be so sore hurt,” said Sir
Gawain, “it is great damage and pity to all this land, for he is
one of the noblest knights that ever I saw in a field handle a spear
or a sword; and if he may be found, I shall find him, for I am sure
he is not far from this town.”</p>

<p>Right so Sir Gawain took a squire with him and rode all about
Camelot within six or seven miles, but so he came again and could
hear no word of him. Then within two days King Arthur and all
the fellowship returned unto London again.</p>

<p>And so as they rode by the way, it happened that Sir Gawain
lodged with Sir Bernard where was Sir Lancelot lodged. And Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Bernard and his daughter, Elaine, came to him to cheer him and
to ask him who did best at that tournament.</p>

<p>“There were two knights,” said Sir Gawain, “that bore two
white shields, but one of them bore a red sleeve upon his head
and certainly he was one of the best knights that ever I saw joust
in field. For I dare say, that one knight with the red sleeve smote
down forty knights of the Table Round and his fellow did right
well and honorably.”</p>

<p>“Now I thank God,” said Elaine, “that that knight sped so
well.”</p>

<p>“Know ye his name?” said Sir Gawain.</p>

<p>“Nay, truly,” said the maiden, “I know not his name, nor
whence he cometh.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, then, how had ye knowledge of him first?” said Sir
Gawain.</p>

<p>Then she told him as ye have heard before, and how her father
intrusted her brother to him to do him service and how her father
lent him her brother’s shield, “And here with me he left his shield,”
she said.</p>

<p>“For what cause did he so?” said Sir Gawain.</p>

<p>“For this cause,” said the damsel, “for his shield was too well
known among many noble knights.”</p>

<p>“Ah, fair damsel,” said Sir Gawain, “please it you let me have
a sight of that shield.”</p>

<p>So when the shield was come, Sir Gawain knew it was Sir
Lancelot’s shield.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said Sir Gawain, “now is my heart heavier than ever it
was before.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Elaine.</p>

<p>“I have great cause,” said Sir Gawain; “the knight that owneth
this shield is the most honorable knight of the world.”</p>

<p>“So I thought ever,” said Elaine.</p>

<p>“But I dread me,” said Sir Gawain, “that ye shall never see
him in this world and that is the greatest pity that ever was of
earthly knight.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” said she, “how may this be? Is he slain?”</p>

<p>“I say not so,” said Sir Gawain, “but he is grievously wounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and more likely to be dead than to be alive and he is the noble
knight, Sir Lancelot, for by this shield I know him.”</p>

<p>“Alas,” said Elaine, “how may this be and what was his
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said Sir Gawain, “the man in the world that loved
him best, hurt him so, and I dare say, if that knight that hurt
him knew that he had hurt Sir Lancelot, it would be the most
sorrow that ever came to his heart.”</p>

<p>“Now, fair father,” said Elaine, “I require you give me leave
to ride and to seek him and my brother, Sir Lavaine.”</p>

<p>“Do as it liketh you,” said her father, “for me sore repenteth
of the hurt of that noble knight.”</p>

<p>Then on the morn Sir Gawain came to King Arthur and told
him how he had found Sir Lancelot’s shield in the keeping of the
fair maiden of Astolat.</p>

<p>“All that I knew beforehand,” said King Arthur, “for I saw
him when he came to his lodging full late in the evening, in
Astolat.”</p>

<p>So the King and all came to London and there Sir Gawain
<a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref302">openly disclosed</a> to all the Court, that it was Sir Lancelot that
jousted best.</p>

<p>And when Sir Bors heard that, he was a sorrowful man and so
were all his kinsmen. And Sir Bors said, “I will haste me to seek
him and find him wheresoever he be and God send me good tidings
of him.”</p>

<h6>SIR LANCELOT AT THE HERMITAGE</h6>

<p>And so we will leave Sir Bors and speak of Sir Lancelot that
lay in great peril. So as Elaine came to Winchester she sought
there all about, and by fortune, Sir Lavaine rode forth to exercise
his horse. And anon as Elaine saw him she knew him, and she
called to him. When he heard her, he came to her and then she
asked her brother how did his lord, Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>“Who told you, sister, that my lord’s name was Sir Lancelot?”</p>

<p>Then she told how Sir Gawain by his shield knew him. So
they rode together until they came to the hermitage. So Sir
Lavaine brought her in to Sir Lancelot and when she saw him so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
sick and pale she said, “My lord Sir Lancelot, alas, why be ye in
this plight?”</p>

<p>But Sir Lancelot said, “Fair maiden, if ye be come to comfort
me, ye be right welcome; and of this little hurt that I have, I shall
be right hastily whole by the grace of God. But, I marvel who
told you my name?”</p>

<p>Then the fair maiden told him all, how Sir Gawain was lodged
with her father, “And there by your shield he discovered you.”</p>

<p>So Elaine watched Sir Lancelot and cared for his wound and
did such attendance to him that the story saith that never man
had a kindlier nurse. Then Sir Lancelot prayed Sir Lavaine to
make inquiries in Winchester for Sir Bors and told him by what
tokens he should know him, by a wound in his forehead.</p>

<p>“For well I am sure that Sir Bors will seek me,” said Sir
Lancelot, “for he is the same good knight that hurt me.”</p>

<p>Now turn we to Sir Bors that came unto Winchester to seek
after his cousin Sir Lancelot. And so when he came to Winchester,
anon there were men that Sir Lavaine had made to watch for
such a man and anon Sir Lavaine had warning; and then Sir
Lavaine came to Winchester and found Sir Bors and there he told
him who he was and with whom he was and what was his name.</p>

<p>“Now, fair knight,” said Sir Bors, “I require you that ye will
bring me to my lord, Sir Lancelot.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Sir Lavaine, “take your horse and within this hour
ye shall see him.”</p>

<p>And so they departed and came to the hermitage. And when
Sir Bors saw Sir Lancelot lie in his bed, pale and discolored, anon
Sir Bors <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref303">lost his countenance</a> and for kindness and pity he might
not speak but wept tenderly for a great while.</p>

<p>And then, when he might speak, he said thus, “O my lord,
Sir Lancelot, God you bless, and send you hasty recovery; and
full heavy am I of my misfortune and mine unhappiness, for now
I may call myself unhappy. And I dread me that God is greatly
displeased with me, that He would suffer me to have such a shame
for to hurt you, that are our leader and our honor and therefore I
call myself unhappy. Alas, that ever such a miserable knight, as
I am, should have power by unhappiness to hurt the noblest knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of the world! Where I so shamefully set upon you and over-charged
you, and where ye might have slain me, ye saved me; and
so did not I, for I and your kindred did to you our uttermost.
I marvel, that my heart or my blood would serve me, wherefore,
my lord Sir Lancelot, I ask your mercy.”</p>

<p>“Fair cousin,” said Sir Lancelot, “ye be right welcome; and
much ye say which pleaseth me not, for I have the same I sought;
for I would with pride have overcome you all, and there in my
pride, I was near slain and that was my own fault, for I might
have given you warning of my being there. And then would I
have had no hurt; for it is an old saying, there is hard battle when
kin and friends do battle, either against other, for there may be no
mercy but mortal war. Therefore, fair cousin, all shall be welcome
that God sendeth; and let us leave off this matter and let
us speak of some rejoicing, for this that is done may not be undone;
and let us find a remedy how soon I may be whole.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Bors leaned upon his bed and told him how Sir
Gawain knew him by the shield he left with the fair maiden of
Astolat and so they talked of many more things. And so within
three or four days Sir Lancelot was big and strong again.</p>

<p>Then Sir Bors told Sir Lancelot how there was a great tournament
and joust agreed upon between King Arthur and the King
of Northgalis.</p>

<p>“Is that the truth?” said Sir Lancelot. “Then shall ye abide
with me still a little while, until that I be whole, for I feel myself
right big and strong.”</p>

<p>Then were they together nigh a month and ever this maiden
Elaine did her diligent labor for Sir Lancelot, so that there never
was a child or wife meeker to her father or husband, than was
that fair maiden of Astolat; wherefore Sir Bors was greatly
pleased with her.</p>

<p>So upon a day, Sir Lancelot thought to try his armor and his
spear. And so when he was upon his horse, he stirred him fiercely,
and the horse was passing strong and fresh, because he had not
been labored for a month. And then Sir Lancelot couched that
spear in the rest. That courser leaped mightily when he felt the
spurs and he that was upon him, the which was the noblest horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in the world, strained him mightily and kept still the spear in the
rest and therewith Sir Lancelot strained himself with so great
force, to get the horse forward that the wound opened and he felt
himself so feeble, that he might not sit upon his horse.</p>

<p>And then Sir Lancelot cried unto Sir Bors, “Ah, Sir Bors and
Sir Lavaine, help me, for I am come to my end.” And therewith
he fell down to the earth as if he were dead.</p>

<p>And then Sir Bors and Sir Lavaine came to him with sorrow.
Then came the holy hermit, Sir Baudwin of Brittany, and when
he found Sir Lancelot in that plight, he said but little, but know
ye well that he was wroth; and then he bade them, “Let us have
him in.”</p>

<p>And so they all bare him into the hermitage and unarmed him
and laid him in his bed and evermore his wound bled piteously, but
he stirred no limb. Then the knight hermit put a little water in
his mouth and Sir Lancelot waked of his swoon and then the hermit
stanched his bleeding.</p>

<p>And when he might speak he asked Sir Lancelot why he put
his life in jeopardy.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Sir Lancelot, “because I thought I had been strong
and also Sir Bors told me that there should be great jousts betwixt
King Arthur and the King of Northgalis and therefore I thought
to try it myself, whether I might be there or not.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Sir Lancelot,” said the hermit, “your heart and your courage
will never be done, until your last day, but ye shall do now
by my counsel. Let Sir Bors depart from you and let him do at
that tournament what he may. And by the grace of God, by that
the tournament be done, and ye come hither again, Sir Lancelot
shall be as whole as ye, if so be that he will be governed by me.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Bors made him ready to depart from Sir Lancelot;
and then Sir Lancelot said, “Fair cousin, Sir Bors, recommend
me unto all them unto whom I ought to recommend me. And I
pray you, exert yourself at the jousts that ye may be best, for
my love; and here shall I abide you at the mercy of God till ye
come again.”</p>

<p>And so Sir Bors departed and came to the court of King Arthur
and told them in what place he had left Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“That grieveth me,” said the King, “but since he shall have his
life we all may thank God.”</p>

<p>And then every knight of the Round Table that was there at
that time present, made him ready to be at the jousts and thither
drew many knights of many countries. And as the time drew
near, thither came the King of Northgalis, and the King with the
Hundred Knights and Sir Galahad, the noble prince, and thither
came the King of Ireland and the King of Scots. So these three
kings came on King Arthur’s party.</p>

<p>And that day Sir Gawain did great deeds of arms and began
first. And the heralds numbered that Sir Gawain smote down
twenty knights. Then Sir Bors came in the same time, and he
was numbered that he smote down twenty knights and therefore
the prize was given betwixt them both, for they began first and
longest endured.</p>

<p>Also Sir Gareth did that day great deeds of arms, for he smote
down and pulled down thirty knights. But when he had done
these deeds he tarried not, but so departed, and therefore he lost
his prize. And Sir Palomides did great deeds of arms that day
for he smote down twenty knights, but he departed suddenly, and
men thought Sir Gareth and he rode together to some adventures.</p>

<p>So when this tournament was done, Sir Bors departed, and
rode till he came to Sir Lancelot, his cousin; and then he found
him on his feet and there either made great joy of other; and so
Sir Bors told Sir Lancelot of all the jousts, like as ye have heard.</p>

<p>“I marvel,” said Sir Lancelot, “at Sir Gareth when he had
done such deeds of arms, that he would not tarry.”</p>

<p>“Thereof we marvel all,” said Sir Bors, “for except you, or
Sir Tristam, or Sir Lamorak, I saw never knight bear down so
many in so little a while, as did Sir Gareth, and anon he was
gone, we knew not where.”</p>

<p>“By my head,” said Sir Lancelot, “he is a noble knight and a
mighty man and well breathed; and if he were well tried, I would
think he were good enough for any knight that beareth the life;
and he is a gentle knight, courteous, true, bounteous, meek, and
mild, and in him is no manner of evil, but he is plain, faithful,
and true.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>So then they made them ready to depart from the hermit. And
so upon a morn, they took their horses and Elaine with them and
when they came to Astolat, they were well lodged and had great
cheer of Sir Bernard, the old baron, and of Sir Torre, his son.
And upon the morrow, Sir Lancelot took his leave and came unto
Winchester.</p>

<p>And when King Arthur knew that Sir Lancelot was come whole
and sound the King made great joy of him, and so did Sir Gawain
and all the knights except Sir Agravaine and Sir Modred.</p>

<h6>THE DEATH OF ELAINE</h6>

<p>Now speak we of the fair maiden of Astolat, that made such
sorrow day and night that she never slept, ate, or drank because
she grieved so for Sir Lancelot. So when she had thus endured
ten days, she became so feeble that she knew she must die.</p>

<p>And then she called her father, Sir Bernard, and her brother,
Sir Torre, and heartily she prayed her father that her brother
might write a letter as she did tell him, and so her father granted
her. And when the letter was written, word by word as she said,
then she prayed her father, saying, “When I am dead, let this
letter be put in my right hand and my hand bound fast with the
letter, and let me be put in a fair bed with all the richest clothes
that I have about me, and so let my bed be laid with me in a
chariot and carried unto the Thames. And there let me be put
within a barge and but one man with me, such as ye trust to steer
me thither. And let my barge be covered with black samite over
and over; thus, father, I beseech you let it be done.”</p>

<p>So her father granted it her faithfully, all things should be
done as she asked. Then her father and her brother made great
sorrow, for they knew she was dying. And so when she was dead
her body was placed in a barge and a man steered the barge unto
Westminster, and there he rowed a great while to and fro before
any saw him.</p>

<p>So by fortune, King Arthur and Queen Guinevere were speaking
together at a window and so as they looked out on the Thames,
they saw this black barge and marveled what it meant. Then the
King called Sir Kay and showed it to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go thither,” said the King to Sir Kay, “and take with you
Sir Brandiles and Sir Agravaine and bring word what is
there.”</p>

<p>Then these knights departed and came to the barge and went
in; and there they found the fair maiden lying in a rich bed, and
a poor man sitting in the barge’s end and no word would he speak.
So these knights returned unto the King again and told him what
they found.</p>

<p>And then the King took the Queen by the hand and went
thither. Then the King made the barge to be held fast and then
the King and Queen entered with certain knights with them, and
there they saw the fairest maiden in a rich bed, covered with
many rich clothes and all was cloth of gold, and she lay as though
she smiled.</p>

<p>Then the Queen saw a letter in her right hand and told the
King. Then the King took it and said, “Now I am sure this letter
will tell what she was and why she is come hither.”</p>

<p>So then the King and the Queen went out of the barge, and so
when the King was come within his chamber, he called many
knights about him, and said he would know openly what was
written within that letter. Then the King opened it and made a
clerk read it, and this was the letter:</p>

<p>“Most noble knight, Sir Lancelot, I was called the Fair Maiden
of Astolat. Pray for my soul and give me burial at least. This
is my last request. Pray for my soul, Sir Lancelot, as thou art
a peerless knight.”</p>

<p>This was all the substance of the letter. And when it was
read, the King, the Queen, and all the knights wept for pity. Then
was Sir Lancelot sent for; and when he was come King Arthur
made the letter to be read to him.</p>

<p>And when Sir Lancelot heard it word by word, he said, “My
lord, King Arthur, I am right sorrowful because of the death of
this fair damsel. She was both fair and good and much was I
indebted to her for her care. I offered her for her kindness that
she showed me, a thousand pounds yearly, whensoever she would
wed some good knight, and always while I live to be her own
knight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Then said the King unto Sir Lancelot, “It will be to your honor
that ye see that she be buried honorably.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Sir Lancelot, “that shall be done as I can best do it.”</p>

<p>And so upon the morn she was buried richly, and all the
knights of the Round Table were there with Sir Lancelot. And
then the poor man went again with the barge.</p>

<h6>THE TOURNAMENT AT WESTMINSTER</h6>

<p>So time passed on till Christmas and then every day there
were jousts made for a diamond, who that jousted best should
have a diamond. But Sir Lancelot would not joust, but if it were
at a great joust. But Sir Lavaine jousted there passing well and
best was praised, for there were but few that did so well. Wherefore,
all manner of knights thought that Sir Lavaine should be
made Knight of the Round Table at the next feast of Pentecost.
So after Christmas, King Arthur called unto him many knights
and there they advised together to make a great tournament.
And the King of Northgalis said to Arthur that he would have
on his party the King of Ireland and the King with the Hundred
Knights and the King of Northumberland and Sir Galahad, the
noble prince. And so then four kings and this mighty duke took
part against King Arthur and the Knights of the Table Round.</p>

<p>And the proclamation was made that the jousts should be at
Westminster, and so the knights made them ready to be at the
jousts in the freshest manner. Then Queen Guinevere sent for
Sir Lancelot and said thus, “I forbid you that ye ride in jousts
or tournaments, unless your kinsmen know you. And at these
jousts that be, ye shall have of me a sleeve of gold, and I charge
you, that ye warn your kinsmen that ye will bear that day the
sleeve of gold upon your helmet.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Sir Lancelot, “it shall be done.”</p>

<p>And when Sir Lancelot saw his time, he told Sir Bors that he
would depart and have no one with him but Sir Lavaine, unto the
good hermit that dwelt in the forest of Windsor, and there he
thought to repose him and take all the rest that he might, so that
he would be fresh at that day of jousts.</p>

<p>So Sir Lancelot and Sir Lavaine departed, that no creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
knew where he was gone, but the noble men of his blood. And
when he was come to the hermitage he had good cheer. And so
daily Sir Lancelot would go to a well, fast by the hermitage and
there he would lie down and see the well spring and bubble, and
sometimes he slept there.</p>

<p>So when the day was come Sir Lancelot planned that he should
be arrayed, and Sir Lavaine and their horses, as though they were
Saracens, and so they departed and came nigh to the field.</p>

<p>The King of Northgalis brought with him a hundred knights,
and the King of Northumberland brought with him a hundred
good knights, and the King of Ireland brought with him a hundred
good knights ready to joust, and Sir Galahad brought with him a
hundred good knights, and the King with the Hundred Knights
brought with him as many, and all these were proved good
knights.</p>

<p>Then came in King Arthur’s party, and there came in the
King of Scots with a hundred knights, and King Uriens brought
with him a hundred knights, and King Howel of Brittany brought
with him a hundred knights, and King Arthur himself came into
the field with two hundred knights and the most part were knights
of the Table Round, that were proved noble knights, and there
were old knights set in a high place, to judge with the Queen who
did best.</p>

<p>Then the heralds blew the call to the field, and then the King
of Northgalis encountered with the King of Scots and then the
King of Scots had a fall: and the King of Ireland smote down King
Uriens and the King of Northumberland smote down King Howel
of Brittany. And then King Arthur was wroth and ran to the
King with the Hundred Knights and there King Arthur smote him
down; and after, with that same spear, King Arthur smote down
three other knights. And when his spear was broken, King Arthur
did exceedingly well; and so therewith came in Sir Gawain and
Sir Gaheris, Sir Agravaine and Sir Modred, and there each of
them smote down a knight, and Sir Gawain smote down four
knights.</p>

<p>Then began a strong battle, for there came in the knights of
Sir Lancelot’s kindred and Sir Gareth and Sir Palomides with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
them, and many knights of the Table Round, and they began to
press the four kings and the mighty duke so hard that they were
discomfited; but this Duke Galahad was a noble knight and by
his <a href="#phrases30" title="List of phrases" id="ref304">mighty prowess</a> he held back the knights of the Table Round.</p>

<p>All this saw Sir Lancelot and then he came into the field with
Sir Lavaine as if it had been thunder. And then anon Sir Bors
and the knights of his kindred saw Sir Lancelot, and Sir Bors said
to them all, “I warn you beware of him with the sleeve of gold
upon his head, for he is Sir Lancelot himself.”</p>

<p>And for great goodness Sir Bors warned Sir Gareth. “I am
well satisfied,” said Sir Gareth, “that I may know him.” “But
who is he,” said they all, “that rideth with him in the same
array?”</p>

<p>“That is the good and gentle knight, Sir Lavaine,” said Sir
Bors.</p>

<p>So Sir Lancelot encountered with Sir Gawain and there by
force Sir Lancelot smote down Sir Gawain and his horse to the
earth, and so he smote down Sir Agravaine and Sir Gaheris and
also he smote down Sir Modred, and all this was with one spear.
Then Sir Lavaine met with Sir Palomides and either met other so
hard and so fiercely, that both their horses fell to the earth. And
then they were horsed again, and then met Sir Lancelot with Sir
Palomides and there Sir Palomides had a fall; and so Sir Lancelot,
without stopping, as fast as he might get spears, smote down thirty
knights and the most part of them were knights of the Table
Round; and ever the knights of his kindred withdrew and fought
in other places where Sir Lancelot came not.</p>

<p>And then King Arthur was wroth when he saw Lancelot do
such deeds for he knew not that it was Sir Lancelot; and then
the King called unto him nine knights and so the King with these
knights made ready to set upon Sir Lancelot and Sir Lavaine.</p>

<p>All this saw Sir Bors and Sir Gareth.</p>

<p>“Now I dread me sore,” said Sir Bors, “that my lord Sir Lancelot
will be hard matched.”</p>

<p>“By my head,” said Sir Gareth, “I will ride unto my lord Sir
Lancelot, to help him, come what may; for he is the same man
that made me knight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye shall not do so by mine counsel,” said Sir Bors, “unless
that ye were disguised.”</p>

<p>“Ye shall see me disguised,” said Sir Gareth.</p>

<p>Therewithal he saw a Welsh knight, who was sore hurt
by Sir Gawain, and to him Gareth rode and prayed him of his
knighthood to lend him his green shield in exchange for his
own.</p>

<p>“I will gladly,” said the Welsh knight.</p>

<p>Then Sir Gareth came driving to Sir Lancelot all he might and
said, “Knight, defend thyself, for yonder cometh King Arthur
with nine knights with him to overcome you, and so I am come
to bear you fellowship for old love ye have showed me.”</p>

<p>“I thank you greatly,” said Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Gareth, “encounter ye with Sir Gawain and I will
encounter with Sir Palomides and let Sir Lavaine match with the
noble King Arthur.”</p>

<p>Then came King Arthur with his nine knights with him, and
Sir Lancelot encountered with Sir Gawain and gave him such a
buffet that Sir Gawain fell to the earth. Then Sir Gareth encountered
with the good knight, Sir Palomides, and he gave him
such a buffet that both he and his horse fell to the earth. Then
encountered King Arthur with Sir Lavaine and there either of
them smote the other to the earth, horse and all, so that they lay
a great while.</p>

<p>Then Sir Lancelot smote down Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and
Sir Modred, and Sir Gareth smote down Sir Kay, Sir Safere, and
Sir Griflet. And then Sir Lavaine was horsed again and he smote
down Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere, and then there began a great
press of good knights. Then Sir Lancelot dashed here and there
and smote off and pulled off helmets, so that none might strike
him a blow with spear or with sword; and Sir Gareth did such
deeds of arms that all men marveled what knight he was with the
green shield, for he smote down that day and pulled down more
than thirty knights.</p>

<p>And Sir Lancelot marveled, when he beheld Sir Gareth do
such deeds, what knight he might be! and Sir Lavaine pulled down
and smote down twenty knights. Also Sir Lancelot knew not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Sir Gareth, for if Sir Tristam or Sir Lamorak had been alive, Sir
Lancelot would have thought he had been one of the two.</p>

<p>So this tournament continued till it was near night, for the
Knights of the Round Table rallied ever unto King Arthur, for
the King was wroth that he and his knights might not prevail that
day. Then Sir Gawain said to the King, “I marvel where all this
day Sir Bors and his fellowship of Sir Lancelot’s kindred have
been. I marvel all this day they be not about you. It is for
some cause,” said Sir Gawain.</p>

<p>“By my head,” said Sir Kay, “Sir Bors is yonder all this day
upon the right hand of this field and there he and his kindred
have won more honor than we have.”</p>

<p>“It may well be,” said Sir Gawain, “but I believe this knight
with the sleeve of gold is Sir Lancelot himself. I know it by his
riding and by his great strokes. And the other knight in the same
colors is the good young knight, Sir Lavaine. Also, that knight
with the green shield is my brother, Sir Gareth, and he has disguised
himself, for no man shall ever make him be against Sir
Lancelot, because he made him knight.”</p>

<p>“Nephew, I believe you,” said King Arthur; “therefore tell
me now what is your best counsel.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Gawain, “ye shall have my counsel. Let the
heralds blow the close of the tournament, for if he be Sir Lancelot
and my brother, Sir Gareth, with him, with the help of that good
young knight, Sir Lavaine, trust me, it will be no use to strive
with them, unless we should fall ten or twelve upon one knight,
and that were no glory, but shame.”</p>

<p>“Ye say truth,” said the King; “it were shame to us, so many
as we be, to set upon them any more; for they be three good
knights and, particularly, that knight with the sleeve of gold.”</p>

<p>So the trumpets blew and forthwith King Arthur sent to the
four kings and to the mighty duke and prayed them that the
knight with the sleeve of gold depart not from them, but that the
King might speak with him. Then King Arthur unarmed him and
rode after Sir Lancelot. And so he found him with the four kings
and the duke and there the King prayed them all unto supper
and they said they would, with good will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>And when they were unarmed, then King Arthur knew Sir
Lancelot, Sir Lavaine and Sir Gareth.</p>

<p>“Ah, Sir Lancelot,” said the King, “this day ye have heated
me and my knights.”</p>

<p>And so they went unto King Arthur’s lodging all together,
and there was a great feast and the prize was given unto Sir
Lancelot; and the heralds announced that he had smitten down
fifty knights, and Sir Gareth, five and thirty, and Sir Lavaine,
four and twenty knights.</p>

<p>Then King Arthur blamed Sir Gareth, because he left his
fellowship and held with Sir Lancelot.</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Sir Gareth, “he made me a knight and when
I saw him so hard pressed, methought it was my duty to help
him, for I saw him do so much and so many noble knights against
him; and when I understood that he was Sir Lancelot, I was
ashamed to see so many knights against him alone.”</p>

<p>“Truly,” said King Arthur unto Sir Gareth, “ye say well, and
manfully have you done and won for yourself great honor, and
all the days of my life I shall love you and trust you more and
more. For ever it is an honorable knight’s deed to help another
honorable knight when he seeth him in great danger; for ever
an honorable man will be sorry to see a brave man shamed. But
he that hath no honor, and acts with cowardice, never shall he
show gentleness nor any manner of goodness, where he seeth a
man in any danger; for then ever will a coward show no mercy.
And always a good man will do ever to another man as he would
be done to himself.”</p>

<p>So then there were great feasts and games and play, and all
manner of noble deeds were done; and he that was courteous,
true, and faithful to his friend, was that time cherished.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Passing of Arthur</span></h5>

<h6>HOW SIR MODRED PLOTTED AGAINST SIR LANCELOT AND OF THE
DEATH OF SIR GAWAIN AND TWELVE KNIGHTS</h6>

<p>Before Merlin passed from the world of men, he uttered many
marvelous prophecies and one that <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref305">boded ill</a> for King Arthur.
He foretold that a son of Arthur’s sister should stir up bitter war
against the King and that a great battle should be fought in the
West when many brave men should find their doom.</p>

<p>Among the nephews of King Arthur was one most dishonorable;
his name was Modred. No knightly deed had he ever done
and he hated even to hear the good report of others. Of all who
sat at the Round Table there was none that Modred hated more
than Sir Lancelot du Lac, whom all true knights held in most
honor. In his <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref306">jealous rage</a> he spoke evil of the Queen and Sir
Lancelot. Now Modred’s brothers, Sir Gawain and Sir Gareth,
refused to listen to these slanders, holding that Sir Lancelot,
in his knightly service to the Queen, did honor to King Arthur
also.</p>

<p>When these evil tales reached King Arthur, he rebuked the
tale bearers and declared his faith in Sir Lancelot and his lady,
the Queen. But Modred, enraged by the rebuke, determined to
find cause against them, and not long after it seemed that the
occasion had come. For when King Arthur had ridden forth to
hunt far from Carlisle, where he then held court, the Queen sent
for Lancelot to speak with her in her bower. Modred and his
brother, Sir Agravaine, got together twelve knights, persuading
them that they were doing the King a service. They waited until
they saw Lancelot enter all unarmed and then called to him to
come forth. The whole court echoed with their cries of
“Traitor.” Lancelot, arming himself in haste, rushed out upon
them and soon the entire company lay cold in death upon the
earth. Only Modred escaped, for he fled, but even so he was
sore wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h6>OF THE TRIAL OF THE QUEEN</h6>

<p>When Modred escaped from Sir Lancelot he got to horse, all
wounded as he was, and never drew rein until he had found King
Arthur, to whom he told all that had happened.</p>

<p>Then great was the King’s grief. Despite all that Modred
could say, he was slow to doubt Sir Lancelot, whom he loved, but
his mind was filled with forebodings; for many a knight had been
slain and well he knew that their kin would seek vengeance on
Sir Lancelot, and the noble fellowship of the Round Table be
utterly destroyed by their feuds.</p>

<p>All too soon it proved even as the King had feared. Many
were found to hold with Sir Modred; some because they were
kin to the knights that had been slain, some from envy of the
honor and worship of the noble Sir Lancelot; and among them
even were those who dared to raise their voice against the Queen
herself, calling for judgment upon her as leagued with a traitor
against the King, and as having caused the death of so many good
knights. Now in those days the law was that if any one were
accused of treason by witnesses, or taken in the act, that one
should die the death by burning, be it man or woman, knight or
churl. So then the murmurs grew to a loud clamor that the law
should have its course, and that King Arthur should pass sentence
on the Queen. Then was the King’s woe doubled.</p>

<p>“For,” said he, “I sit as King to be a rightful judge and keep
all the law; wherefore I may not do battle for my own Queen, and
now there is none other to help her.”</p>

<p>So a decree was issued that Queen Guinevere should be burnt
at the stake outside the walls of Carlisle.</p>

<p>Forthwith, King Arthur sent for his nephew, Sir Gawain, and
said to him:</p>

<p>“Fair nephew, I give it in charge to you to see that all is done
as has been decreed.”</p>

<p>But Sir Gawain answered boldly: “Sir King, never will I be
present to see my lady the Queen die. It is of <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref307">ill counsel</a> that ye
have consented to her death.”</p>

<p>Then the King bade Gawain send his two young brothers, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Gareth and Sir Gaheris, to receive his commands, and these he
desired to attend the Queen to the place of execution. So Gareth
made answer for both:</p>

<p>“My Lord the King, we owe you obedience in all things, but
know that it is sore against our wills that we obey you in this;
nor will we appear in arms in the place where that noble lady
shall die”; then sorrowfully they mounted their horses and rode
to Carlisle.</p>

<p>When the day appointed had come, the Queen was led forth
to a place without the walls of Carlisle, and there she was bound
to the stake to be burnt to death. Loud were her ladies’ lamentations,
and many a lord was found to weep at that grievous sight
of a Queen brought so low; yet was there none who dared come
forward as her champion, lest he should be suspected of treason.
As for Gareth and Gaheris, they could not bear the sight, and
stood with their faces covered in their mantles. Then, just as
the torch was to be applied to the fagots, there was a sound as
of many horses galloping, and the next instant a band of knights
rushed upon the astonished throng, their leader cutting down all
who crossed his path until he had reached the Queen, whom he
lifted to his saddle and bore <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref308">from the press</a>. Then all men knew
that it was Sir Lancelot, come knightly to rescue the Queen, and
in their hearts they rejoiced. So with little hindrance they rode
away, Sir Lancelot and all his kin with the Queen in their midst,
till they came to the castle of the Joyous Garde, where they held
the Queen in safety and all reverence.</p>

<p>But of that day came a kingdom’s ruin; for among the slain
were Gawain’s brothers Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris. Now Sir
Lancelot loved Sir Gareth as if he had been his own younger
brother, and himself had knighted him; but, in the press, he
struck at him and killed him, not seeing that he was unarmed
and weaponless; and in like wise, Sir Gaheris met his death. So
when word was brought to King Arthur of what had passed, Sir
Gawain asked straightway how his brothers had fared.</p>

<p>“Both are slain,” said the messenger.</p>

<p>“Alas! my dear brothers!” cried Sir Gawain; “how came they
by their death?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“They were both slain by Sir Lancelot,” said the messenger.</p>

<p>“That will I never believe,” cried Sir Gawain; “for my brother,
Sir Gareth, had such love for Sir Lancelot that there was naught
Sir Lancelot could ask him that he would not do.”</p>

<p>But the man said again, “He is slain, and by Sir Lancelot.”</p>

<p>Then, from sheer grief, Sir Gawain fell swooning to the
ground. When he was recovered, he said:</p>

<p>“My lord and uncle, is it even as this man says, that Sir
Lancelot has slain my brother Sir Gareth?”</p>

<p>“Alas!” said the King. “Lancelot rode upon him in the press
and slew him, not seeing who he was or that he was unarmed.”</p>

<p>“Then,” cried Gawain fiercely, “here I make my vow. Never,
while my life lasts, will I leave Sir Lancelot in peace until he has
<a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref309">rendered me account</a> for the slaying of my brothers.”</p>

<p>From that day forth, Sir Gawain would not suffer the King
to rest until he had gathered all his host and marched against
the Joyous Garde. Thus began the war which broke up the fellowship
of the Round Table.</p>

<h6>HOW SIR GAWAIN DEFIED SIR LANCELOT</h6>

<p>Now it came to the ears of the Pope in Rome that King Arthur
was besieging Sir Lancelot in the castle of the Joyous Garde, and
it grieved him that there should be strife between two such goodly
knights, the like of whom was not to be found in Christendom.
So he called to him the Bishop of Rochester and bade him carry
word to Britain, both to Arthur and to Sir Lancelot, that they
should be reconciled, the one to the other, and that King Arthur
should receive again Queen Guinevere.</p>

<p>Forthwith Sir Lancelot desired of King Arthur assurance of
liberty and reverence for the Queen, as also <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref310">safe conduct</a> for
himself and his knights, that he might bring Queen Guinevere
with due honor to the King at Carlisle; and thereto the King
pledged his word.</p>

<p>So Lancelot set forth with the Queen, and behind them rode
a hundred knights arrayed in green velvet, the <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref311">housings of the
horses</a> of the same, all studded with precious stones; thus they
passed through the city of Carlisle openly, in the sight of all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
there were many who rejoiced that the Queen was come again
and Sir Lancelot with her, though they of Gawain’s party scowled
upon him.</p>

<p>When they were come into the great hall where Arthur sat
with Sir Gawain and other great lords about him, Sir Lancelot
led Guinevere to the throne and both knelt before the King; then
rising, Sir Lancelot lifted the Queen to her feet and thus he spoke
to King Arthur, boldly and well, before the whole court:</p>

<p>“My lord, Sir Arthur, I bring you here your Queen, than whom
no truer nor nobler lady ever lived; and here stand I, Sir Lancelot
du Lac, ready to do battle with any that dare gainsay it”; and
with these words Sir Lancelot turned and looked upon the lords
and knights present in their places, but none would challenge him
in that cause, not even Sir Gawain, for he had ever affirmed that
Queen Guinevere was a true and honorable lady.</p>

<p>Then Sir Lancelot spoke again: “Now, my Lord Arthur, in
my own defense <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref312">it behooves me</a> to say that never in aught have
I been false to you. That I slew certain knights is true, but I
hold me guiltless, seeing that they brought death upon themselves.
For no sooner had I gone to the Queen’s bower, as she had
commanded me, than they beset the door with shameful outcry,
that all the court might hear, calling me traitor and <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref313">felon
knight</a>.”</p>

<p>“And rightly they called you,” cried Sir Gawain fiercely.</p>

<p>“My Lord, Sir Gawain,” answered Sir Lancelot, “in their
quarrel they proved not themselves right, else had not I, alone,
encountered fourteen knights and come forth unscathed.”</p>

<p>Then said King Arthur: “Sir Lancelot, I have ever loved
you above all other knights, and trusted you to the uttermost;
but ill have ye done by me and mine.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” said Lancelot, “that I slew Sir Gareth I shall
mourn as long as life lasts. As soon would I have slain my own
nephew, Sir Bors, as have harmed Sir Gareth wittingly; for I
myself made him knight, and loved him as a brother.”</p>

<p>“Liar and traitor,” cried Sir Gawain, “ye slew him, defenseless
and unarmed.”</p>

<p>“It is full plain, Sir Gawain,” said Lancelot, “that never again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
shall I have your love; and yet there has been old kindness between
us, and once ye thanked me that I saved your life.”</p>

<p>“It shall not avail you now,” said Sir Gawain; “traitor ye are,
both to the King and to me. Know that while life lasts, never
will I rest until I have avenged my brother Sir Gareth’s death
upon you.”</p>

<p>“Fair nephew,” said the King, “cease your bawling. Sir
Lancelot has come <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref314">under surety of my word</a> that none shall do
him harm. Elsewhere, and at another time, <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref315">fasten a quarrel upon
him</a>, if quarrel ye must.”</p>

<p>“I care not,” cried Sir Gawain fiercely. “The proud traitor
trusts so in his own strength that he thinks none dare meet him.
But here I defy him and swear that, be it in open combat or <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref316">by
stealth</a>, I shall have his life. And know, mine uncle and King,
if I shall not have your aid, I and mine will leave you for ever
and, if need be, fight even against you.”</p>

<p>“Peace,” said the King, and to Sir Lancelot: “We give you
fifteen days in which to leave this kingdom.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Lancelot sighed heavily and said, “Full well I see
that no sorrow of mine for what is past availeth me.”</p>

<p>Then he went to the Queen where she sat, and said: “Madam,
the time is come when I must leave this fair realm that I have
loved. Think well of me, I pray you, and send for me if ever
there be aught in which a true knight may serve a lady.” Therewith
he turned him about and, without greeting to any, passed
through the hall, and with his faithful knights, rode to the Joyous
Garde, though ever thereafter, in memory of that sad day, he
called it the Dolorous Garde.</p>

<p>There he called about him his friends and kinsmen, saying,
“Fair knights, I must now pass into my own lands.” Then they
all, with one voice, cried that they would go with him. So he
thanked them, promising them all fair estates and great honor
when they were come to his kingdom; for all France belonged to
Sir Lancelot. Yet was he loath to leave the land where he had
followed so many glorious adventures, and sore he mourned to
part in anger from King Arthur.</p>

<p>“My mind misgives me,” said Sir Lancelot, “but that trouble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
shall come of Sir Modred, for he is envious and a mischief-maker,
and it grieves me that never more I may serve King Arthur and
his realm.”</p>

<p>So Sir Lancelot sorrowed; but his kinsmen, wroth for the dishonor
done him, made haste to depart and, by the fifteenth day,
they were all embarked to sail overseas to France.</p>

<h6>HOW KING ARTHUR AND SIR GAWAIN WENT TO FRANCE</h6>

<p>From the day when Sir Lancelot brought the Queen to Carlisle,
never would Gawain suffer the King to be at rest; but always
he desired him to call his army together that they might go to
attack Sir Lancelot in his own land.</p>

<p>Now King Arthur was loath to war against Sir Lancelot, and
seeing this, Sir Gawain upbraided him bitterly.</p>

<p>“I see well it is naught to you that my brother, Sir Gareth,
died <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref317">fulfilling your behest</a>. Little ye care if all your knights be
slain, if only the traitor Lancelot escape. Since, then, ye will
not do me justice nor avenge your own nephew, I and my fellows
will take the traitor when and how we may. He trusts in his
own might that none can encounter with him; let see if we may
not entrap him.”</p>

<p>Thus urged, King Arthur called his army together and ordered
that a great fleet be collected; for rather would he fight openly
with Sir Lancelot than that Sir Gawain should bring such dishonor
upon himself as to slay a noble knight treacherously. So
with a great host, the King passed overseas to France, leaving
Sir Modred to rule Britain in his stead.</p>

<p>When Lancelot heard that King Arthur and Sir Gawain were
coming against him, he withdrew into the strong castle of Benwick;
for unwilling, indeed, was he to fight with the King, or to
do an injury to Sir Gareth’s brother. The army passed through
the land, laying it waste, and presently encamped about the castle,
besieging it closely; but so thick were the walls and so watchful
the garrison that in no way could they prevail against it.</p>

<p>One day, there came to Sir Lancelot seven brethren, brave
knights of Wales, who had joined their fortunes to his, and said:</p>

<p>“Sir Lancelot, bid us sally forth against this host which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
invaded and laid waste your lands, and we will scatter it; for we
are not wont to cower behind walls.”</p>

<p>“Fair lords,” answered Lancelot, “it is grief to me to war on
good Christian knights and especially upon my lord, King Arthur.
Have but patience, and I will send to him and see if, even now,
there may not be a treaty of peace between us, for better far is
peace than war.”</p>

<p>So Sir Lancelot sought out a damsel and, mounting her upon
a palfrey, bade her ride to King Arthur’s camp and require of
the King to cease warring on his lands, proffering fair terms of
peace. When the damsel came to the camp, there met her Sir
Lucan the Butler.</p>

<p>“Fair damsel,” said Sir Lucan, “do ye come from Sir Lancelot?”</p>

<p>“Yea, in good truth,” said the damsel; “and, I pray you, lead
me to King Arthur.”</p>

<p>“Now may ye prosper in your errand,” said Sir Lucan. “Our
King loves Sir Lancelot dearly and wishes him well; but Sir
Gawain will not suffer him to be reconciled to him.”</p>

<p>So when the damsel had come before the King, she told him
all her tale, and much she said of Sir Lancelot’s love and goodwill
to his lord the King, so that the tears stood in Arthur’s eyes.
But Sir Gawain broke in roughly:</p>

<p>“My lord and uncle, shall it be said of us that we came hither
with such a host <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref318">to hie us home</a> again, nothing done, to be <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref319">the
scoff of all men</a>?”</p>

<p>“Nephew,” said the King, “methinks Sir Lancelot offers fair
and generously. It were well if ye would accept his proffer.
Nevertheless, as the quarrel is yours, so shall the answer be.”</p>

<p>“Then, damsel,” said Sir Gawain, “say unto Sir Lancelot that
the time for peace is past. And tell him that I, Sir Gawain, swear
by the <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref320">faith I owe to knighthood</a> that never will I forego my
revenge.”</p>

<p>So the damsel returned to Sir Lancelot and told him all. Sir
Lancelot’s heart was filled with grief nigh unto breaking; but
his knights were enraged and clamored that he had endured too
much of insult and wrong, and that he should lead them forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
to battle. Sir Lancelot armed him sorrowfully and presently the
gates were set open and he rode forth, he and all his company.
But to all his knights he had given commandment that none should
seek King Arthur; “for never,” said he, “will I see the noble King
who made me knight, either killed or shamed.”</p>

<p>Fierce was the battle between those two hosts. On Lancelot’s
side, Sir Bors and Sir Lavaine and many another did right well;
while on the other side, King Arthur bore him as the noble knight
he was, and Sir Gawain raged through the battle, seeking to come
at Sir Lancelot. Presently, Sir Bors encountered King Arthur
and unhorsed him. This Sir Lancelot saw and, coming to the
King’s side, he alighted and raising him from the ground, mounted
him upon his own horse. Then King Arthur, looking upon Lancelot,
cried, “Ah! Lancelot, Lancelot! That ever there should be
war between us two!” and tears stood in the King’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah! my Lord Arthur,” cried Sir Lancelot, “I pray you stop
this war.”</p>

<p>As they spoke thus, Sir Gawain came upon them and, calling
Sir Lancelot traitor and coward, had almost ridden upon him
before Lancelot could find another horse. Then the two hosts
drew back, each on its own side, to see the battle between Sir
Lancelot and Sir Gawain; for they wheeled their horses and,
departing far asunder, rushed again upon each other with the
noise of thunder, and each bore the other from his horse. Then
they put their shields before them and set on each other with
their swords; but while ever Sir Gawain smote fiercely, Sir Lancelot
was content only to ward off blows, because he would not,
for Sir Gareth’s sake, do any harm to Sir Gawain. But the more
Sir Lancelot forebore him, the more furiously Sir Gawain struck,
so that Sir Lancelot had much ado to defend himself and at the
last smote Gawain on the helm so mightily that he bore him to
the ground. Then Sir Lancelot stood back from Sir Gawain.
But Gawain cried:</p>

<p>“Why do ye draw back, traitor knight? Slay ye while ye
may, for never will I cease to be your enemy while my life lasts.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” said Lancelot, “I shall withstand you as I may; but
never will I smite a fallen knight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he spoke to King Arthur: “My Lord, I pray you, if only
for this day, draw off your men. And think upon our former love
if ye may; but, be ye friend or foe, God keep you.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Sir Lancelot drew off his men into his castle and
King Arthur and his company to their tents. As for Sir Gawain,
his squires bore him to his tent where his wounds were dressed.</p>

<h6>OF MODRED THE TRAITOR</h6>

<p>So Sir Gawain lay healing of the grim wound which Sir Lancelot
had given him, and there was peace between the two armies,
when there came messengers from Britain bearing letters for
King Arthur; and more evil news than they brought might not
well be, for they told how Sir Modred had usurped his uncle’s
realm. First, he had caused it to be <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref321">noised abroad</a> that King
Arthur was slain in battle with Sir Lancelot and, since there be
many ever ready to believe any <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref322">idle rumor</a> and eager for any
change, it had been no hard task for Sir Modred to call the lords
to a Parliament and persuade them to make him king. But the
Queen could not be brought to believe that her lord was dead, so
she took refuge in the Tower of London from Sir Modred’s violence,
nor was she to be induced to leave her strong refuge for
aught that Modred could promise or threaten.</p>

<p>This was the news that came to Arthur as he lay encamped
about Sir Lancelot’s castle of Benwick. Forthwith, he bade his
host make ready to move and, when they had reached the coast
they embarked and made sail to reach Britain with all possible
speed.</p>

<p>Sir Modred, on his part, had heard of their sailing and hasted
to get together a great army. It was grievous to see how many
a stout knight held by Modred, ay, even many whom Arthur
himself had raised to honor and fortune; for it is the nature of
men to be fickle. Thus it was that, when Arthur drew near to
Dover, he found Modred with a mighty host waiting to oppose
his landing. Then there was a great sea-fight, those of Modred’s
party going out in boats, great and small, to board King Arthur’s
ships and slay him and his men or ever they should come to land.
Right valiantly, did King Arthur bear him, <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref323">as was his wont</a>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
boldly his followers fought in his cause, so that at last they drove
off their enemies and landed at Dover in spite of <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref324">Modred and his
array</a>. For that time Modred fled, and King Arthur bade those of
his party bury the slain and tend the wounded.</p>

<p>So as they passed from ship to ship, salving and binding the
hurts of the men, they came at last upon Sir Gawain, where he
lay at the bottom of a boat, wounded to the death, for he had
received a great blow on the wound that Sir Lancelot had given
him. They bore him to his tent and his uncle, the King, came to
him, <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref325">sorrowing beyond measure</a>.</p>

<p>“Methinks,” said the King, “my joy on earth is done; for
never have I loved any men as I have loved you, my nephew, and
Sir Lancelot. Sir Lancelot I have lost, and now I see you on your
death-bed.”</p>

<p>“My King,” said Sir Gawain, “my hour is come and I have
got my death at Sir Lancelot’s hand; for I am smitten on the
wound he gave me. And rightly am I served, for of my wilfulness
and stubbornness comes this unhappy war. I pray you, my
uncle, raise me in your arms and let me write to Sir Lancelot
before I die.”</p>

<p>Thus, then, Sir Gawain wrote: “To Sir Lancelot, the noblest
of all knights, I, Gawain, send greeting before I die. For I am
smitten on the wound ye gave me before your castle of Benwick
in France, and I bid all men bear witness that I sought my own
death and that ye are innocent of it. I pray you, by our friendship
of old, come again into Britain and, when ye look upon my
tomb, pray for Gawain of Orkney. Farewell.”</p>

<p>So Sir Gawain died and was buried in the Chapel at Dover.</p>

<h6>OF THE BATTLE IN THE WEST</h6>

<p>The day after the battle at Dover, King Arthur and his host
pursued Sir Modred to Barham Down, where again there was a
great battle fought, with much slaughter on both sides; but, in
the end, Arthur was victorious, and Modred fled to Canterbury.</p>

<p>Now by this time, many that Modred had cheated by his
lying reports, had drawn unto King Arthur, to whom at heart
they had ever been loyal, knowing him for a true and noble King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
and hating themselves for having been deceived by such a false
usurper as Sir Modred. Then when he found that he was being
deserted, Sir Modred withdrew to the far West, for there men
knew less of what had happened, and so he might still find some
to believe in him and support him; and being without conscience,
he even called to his aid the <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref326">heathen hosts</a> that his uncle, King
Arthur, had driven from the land in the good years when Lancelot
was of the Round Table.</p>

<p>King Arthur followed ever after, for in his heart was bitter
anger against the false nephew who had brought woe upon him
and all his realm. At the last, when Modred could flee no further,
the two hosts were drawn up near the shore of the great
western sea; and it was the Feast of the Holy Trinity.</p>

<p>That night, as King Arthur slept, he thought that Sir Gawain
stood before him, looking just as he did in life, and said to him:</p>

<p>“My uncle and my King, God in his great love has suffered
me to come unto you, to warn you that in no wise ye fight on the
morrow; for if ye do, ye shall be slain and with you the most part
of the people on both sides. Make ye, therefore, treaty for a
month and within that time, Sir Lancelot shall come to you with
all his knights and ye shall overthrow the traitor and all that
hold with him.”</p>

<p>Therewith Sir Gawain vanished. Immediately the King
awoke and called to him the best and wisest of his knights, the
two brethren, Sir Lucan the Butler and Sir Bedivere and others,
to whom he told his dream. Then all were agreed that, on any
terms whatsoever, a treaty should be made with Sir Modred, even
as Sir Gawain had said; and with the dawn, messengers went to
the camp of the enemy, to call Sir Modred to a conference. So it
was determined that the meeting should take place in the sight
of both armies, in an open space between the two camps, and that
King Arthur and Modred should each be accompanied by fourteen
knights. Little enough faith had either in the other, so
when they set forth to the meeting, they bade their hosts join
battle if ever they saw a sword drawn. Thus they went to the
conference.</p>

<p>Now as they talked, it happened that an adder, coming out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
a bush hard by, stung a knight in the foot; and he, seeing the
snake, drew his sword to kill it and thought no harm thereby.
But on the instant that the sword flashed, the trumpets blared on
both sides and the two hosts rushed to battle. Never was there
fought a fight of such bitter enmity, for brother fought with
brother, and comrade with comrade, and fiercely they cut and
thrust, with many a bitter word between; while King Arthur
himself, his heart hot within him, rode through and through the
battle, seeking the traitor Modred. So they fought all day till
at last the evening fell. Then Arthur, looking around him, saw
of his valiant knights but two left, Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere,
and these sore wounded; and there, over against him, by a great
heap of the dead, stood Sir Modred, the cause of all this ruin.
Thereupon the King, his heart nigh broken with grief for the loss
of his true knights, cried with a loud voice, “Traitor! now is thy
doom upon thee!” and with his spear gripped in both hands, he
rushed upon Sir Modred and smote him that the weapon stood
out a fathom behind. And Sir Modred knew that he had his
death-wound. With all the might that he had, he thrust him up
the spear to the haft and, with his sword, struck King Arthur
upon the head that the steel pierced the helmet and bit into the
head; then Sir Modred fell back, stark and dead.</p>

<p>Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere went to the King where he lay,
swooning from the blow, and bore him to a little chapel on the
seashore. As they laid him on the ground, Sir Lucan fell dead
beside the King, and Arthur, coming to himself, found but Sir
Bedivere alive beside him.</p>

<h6>THE DEATH OF ARTHUR</h6>

<p>So King Arthur lay wounded to the death, grieving, not that
his end was come, but for the desolation of his kingdom and the
loss of his good knights. And looking upon the body of Sir Lucan,
he sighed and said:</p>

<p>“Alas! true knight, dead for my sake! If I lived, I should ever
grieve for thy death, but now mine own end draws nigh.”</p>

<p>Then turning to Sir Bedivere, who stood sorrowing beside
him, he said: “Leave weeping now, for the time is short and much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to do. Hereafter shalt thou weep if thou wilt. But take now
my sword Excalibur, hasten to the water side and fling it into
the deep. Then watch what happens and bring me word thereof.”</p>

<p>“My Lord,” said Sir Bedivere, “your command shall be
obeyed”; and taking the sword, he departed. But as he went on
his way he looked on the sword, how wondrously it was formed,
and the hilt all studded with precious stones; and, as he looked,
he called to mind the marvel by which it had come into the King’s
keeping. For on a certain day, as Arthur walked on the shore
of a great lake, there had appeared above the surface of the water
a hand brandishing a sword. On the instant, the King had leaped
into a boat, and, rowing into the lake, had got the sword and
brought it back to land. Then he had seen how, on one side the
blade, was written, “Keep me,” but on the other, “Throw me
away,” and sore perplexed, he had shown it to Merlin, the great
wizard, who said: “Keep it now. The time for casting away has
not yet come.”</p>

<p>Thinking on this, it seemed to Bedivere that no good, but
harm, must come of obeying the King’s word; so hiding the sword
under a tree, he hastened back to the little chapel.</p>

<p>Then said the King: “What saw’st thou?”</p>

<p>“Sir,” answered Bedivere, “I saw naught but the waves, heard
naught but the wind.”</p>

<p>“That is untrue,” said King Arthur; “<a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref327">I charge thee</a>, as thou
art true knight, go again and spare not to throw away the sword.”</p>

<p>Sir Bedivere departed a second time and his mind was to obey
his lord; but when he took the sword in his hand, he thought:</p>

<p>“Sin it is and shameful, to throw away so glorious a sword.”
Then hiding it again, he hastened back to the King.</p>

<p>“What saw’st thou?” said King Arthur.</p>

<p>“Sir, I saw the water lap on the crags.”</p>

<p>Then spoke the King in great wrath: “Traitor and unkind!
Twice hast thou betrayed me! Art dazzled by the splendor of
the jewels, thou that, till now, hast ever been dear and true to
me? Go yet again, but if thou fail me this time, I will arise and,
with mine own hands, slay thee.”</p>

<p>Then Sir Bedivere left the King and, that time, he took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sword quickly from the place where he had hidden it and, forbearing
even to look upon it, he twisted the belt about it and
flung it with all his force into the water. A wondrous sight he
saw, for, as the sword touched the water, a hand rose from out the
deep, caught it, brandished it thrice and threw it beneath the
surface.</p>

<p>So Bedivere hastened back to the King and told him what he
had seen.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Arthur; “now, bear me to the water’s edge
and hasten, I pray thee, for I have tarried over long and my
wound has taken cold.”</p>

<p>So Sir Bedivere raised the King on his back and bore him
tenderly to the lonely shore, where the lapping waves floated
many an empty helmet and the fitful moonlight fell on the upturned
faces of the dead. Scarce had they reached the shore
when there hove in sight a barge, and on its deck stood three tall
women, robed all in black and wearing crowns on their heads.</p>

<p>“Place me in the barge,” said Arthur, and softly Sir Bedivere
lifted the King into it. And these three queens wept sore over
Arthur, and one took his head in her lap and <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref328">chafed his hands</a>,
crying:</p>

<p>“Alas! my brother, thou hast been overlong in coming, and I
fear me thy wound has taken cold.”</p>

<p>Then the barge began to move slowly forth from the land.
When Sir Bedivere saw this, he lifted up his voice and cried with
a bitter cry:</p>

<p>“Ah! my Lord Arthur, thou art taken from me! And I,
whither shall I go?”</p>

<p>“Comfort thyself,” said the King, “for in me is no comfort
more. I pass to the Valley of Avilion, to heal me of my grievous
wound. If thou seest me never again, pray for me.”</p>

<p>So the barge floated away out of sight and Sir Bedivere stood
straining his eyes after it till it had vanished utterly. Then he
turned him about and journeyed through the forest until, at day-break,
he reached a hermitage. Entering it, he prayed the holy
hermit that he might abide with him and there he spent the rest
of his life in prayer and holy exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>But of King Arthur is no more known. Some men, indeed,
say that he is not dead, but abides in the happy Valley of Avilion
until such time as his country’s need is sorest, when he shall
come again and deliver it. Others say that, of a truth, he is dead
and that, in the far West, his tomb may be seen and written on
it these words:</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Here Lies Arthur, Once King
and King to Be.</span>”</p>

<h6>HOW QUEEN GUINEVERE BECAME A NUN AT ALMESBURY AND OF
THE DEATH OF SIR LANCELOT</h6>

<p>When news reached Sir Lancelot in his own land of the treason
of Modred, he gathered his lords and knights together, and rested
not till he had come to Britain to aid King Arthur. He landed
at Dover and there the evil tidings were told him, how the King
had met his death at the hands of his traitor nephew. Then was
Sir Lancelot’s heart nigh broken for grief.</p>

<p>“Alas!” he cried, “that I should live to know my King overthrown
by such a felon! What have I done that I should have
caused the deaths of the good knights Sir Gareth, Sir Gaheris,
and Sir Gawain, and yet that such a villain should escape my
sword!”</p>

<p>Then he desired to be led to Sir Gawain’s tomb, where he
remained long in prayer and in great lamentation; after which,
he called to him his kinsmen and friends and said to them:</p>

<p>“My fair lords, I thank you all most heartily that, of your
courtesy, ye came with me to this land. That we be come too
late is a misfortune that might not be avoided, though I shall
mourn it my life long. And now I will ride forth alone to find
my lady the Queen in the West, whither men say she has fled.
Wait for me, I pray you, for fifteen days and then, if ye hear
naught of me, return to your own lands.”</p>

<p>So Sir Lancelot rode forth alone, nor would he suffer any to
follow him despite their prayers and entreaties.</p>

<p>Thus he rode some seven or eight days until, at the last, he
came to a nunnery where he saw in the cloister many nuns waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
on a fair lady, none other, indeed, than Queen Guinevere
herself. And she, looking up, saw Sir Lancelot and, at the sight,
grew so pale that her ladies feared for her; but she recovered and
bade them go and bring Sir Lancelot to her presence. When he
was come, she said to him:</p>

<p>“Sir Lancelot, glad am I to see thee once again that I may bid
thee farewell; for in this world shall we never meet again.”</p>

<p>“Sweet Madam,” answered Sir Lancelot, “I was minded, with
your leave, to bear you to my own country, where I doubt not but
I should guard you well and safely from your enemies.”</p>

<p>“Nay, Lancelot,” said the Queen, “that may not be; I am
resolved never to look upon the world again, but here to pass my
life in prayer and in such good works as I may. But thou, do thou
get back to thine own land and take a fair wife, and ye both
shall ever have my prayers.”</p>

<p>“Madam,” replied Sir Lancelot, “ye know well that shall
never be. And since ye are resolved to lead a life of prayer, I,
too, will forsake the world if I can find hermit to share his cell
with me; for ever your will has been mine.”</p>

<p>Long and earnestly he looked upon her as though he might
never gaze enough; then, getting to horse, he rode slowly away.</p>

<p>Nor did they ever meet again in life. For Queen Guinevere
abode in the great nunnery of Almesbury where Sir Lancelot had
found her and presently, for the holiness of her life, was made
Abbess. But Sir Lancelot, after he had left her, rode on his way
till he came to the cell where Sir Bedivere dwelt with the holy
hermit; and when Sir Bedivere had told him all that had befallen,
of the great battle in the West, and of the passing away of Arthur,
Sir Lancelot flung down his arms and implored the holy hermit to
let him remain there as the servant of God. So Sir Lancelot
<a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref329">donned the serge gown</a> and abode in the hermitage as the priest
of God.</p>

<p>Presently, there came riding that way the good Sir Bors,
Lancelot’s nephew; for, when Sir Lancelot returned not to Dover,
Sir Bors and many another knight went forth in search of him.
There, then, Sir Bors remained and, within a half year, there
joined themselves to these three many who in former days had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
been fellows of the Round Table; and the fame of their piety
spread far and wide.</p>

<p>So six years passed and then, one night, Lancelot had a vision.
It seemed to him that one said to him:</p>

<p>“Lancelot, arise and go in haste to Almesbury. There shalt
thou find Queen Guinevere dead and it shall be for thee to bury
her.”</p>

<p>Sir Lancelot arose at once and, calling his fellows to him, told
them his dream. Immediately, with all haste, they set forth
toward Almesbury and, arriving there the second day, found the
Queen dead, as had been foretold in the vision. So with the state
and ceremony befitting a great Queen, they buried her in the
Abbey of Glastonbury, in that same church where, some say,
King Arthur’s tomb is to be found. Lancelot it was who performed
the <a href="#phrases31" title="List of phrases" id="ref330">funeral rites</a> and chanted the requiem; but when all
was done, he pined away, growing weaker daily. So at the end
of six weeks, he called to him his fellows and, bidding them all
farewell, desired that his dead body should be conveyed to the
Joyous Garde, there to be buried, for that in the church at Glastonbury
he was not worthy to lie. And that same night he died,
and was buried, as he had desired, in his own castle. So passed
from the world the bold Sir Lancelot du Lac, bravest, most courteous,
and most gentle of knights, whose peer the world has never
seen nor ever shall see.</p>

<p>After Sir Lancelot’s death, Sir Bors and the pious knights,
his companions, took their way to the Holy Land and there they
died in battle against the Turk.</p>

<p>So ends this story of King Arthur and his noble fellowship of
the Round Table.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> The old folk ballads, of which this one is an excellent
example, have all come down to us from the far-off past. Such ballads
are not the work of any one author, but like the stories of King Arthur, were
preserved mainly in the memories of men. Some of them were sung or
recited to the music of the harp or lute by minstrels who wandered from
village to village, and from castle to castle, entertaining their hearers in
return for food and lodging; or by the bards and minstrels who were maintained
by kings and nobles to entertain them and to celebrate their deeds
and honors. Often they were made by the people, not by professional
singers, and were expressions of the folk love of adventure. Indeed, the
best definition of a popular, or folk, ballad is that it is “a tale telling itself
in song.” This means that a ballad always tells a story; that it has no
known author, being composed by several people or by a community and
then handed down orally, not in writing, from generation to generation;
and finally, that it is sung, not recited. In this way such folk ballads as
“Sir Patrick Spens” were transmitted for generations, in different versions,
before they were written down and became a part of what we call <em>literature</em>,
that is, something written. When the invention of the printing press
made it possible to put these old ballads in a permanent form, they were
collected from the recitations of old men and women who knew them, and
printed. Thus they have become a precious literary possession, telling us
something of the life, the history, and the standards, superstitions, and
beliefs of distant times, and thrilling us with their stirring stories. The
beauty of these old ballads lies in the story they tell, and in their directness
and simplicity. They are almost wholly without literary ornament; their
language is the language of the people, not of the court.</p>

<p>Many modern poets have written stories in verse which are also called
ballads. Some are in imitation of the old ballads, using the old ballad
meter and riming system, and employing old-fashioned words and expressions,
to add to the effect. Other modern ballads are simple narratives in
verse—short stories dealing with stirring subjects, with battle, adventure,
etc. But while the true old ballad holds the attention upon the story only,
the modern ballads often introduce descriptions of the characters.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Why did the king choose Sir Patrick Spens? 2. What
did Sir Patrick say when he had read the king’s letter? 3. What signs of a
storm had been noticed? 4. Point out all the ways in which the ballad
tells that the ship was wrecked. 5. How have the old ballads come down
to us? 6. What other old ballad have you read? 7. Tell how the old
ballads came into being, and name a characteristic of them. 8. What do the
old ballads tell us of the life of the early people? 9. How does a modern
ballad differ from a folk, or popular, ballad?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p>For Biography, <a href="#Page_81">see page 81</a>.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. With which stanza does the narrative begin? 2. What
may the first three stanzas be called? 3. Which of these three stanzas is
descriptive? 4. In which does the Viking make himself known? 5. In
what stanzas is the story told? 6. With what line does the story end?
7. What relation to the poem has the last line? 8. Describe the scene suggested
by the first stanza; who is speaking? 9. Describe the guest to whom
the poet speaks. 10. In using the word “fearful” to describe this guest,
was the poet emphasizing only the outward appearance of his guest?
11. Can you use other words equally exact and poetical for “daunt” and
“haunt”? 12. Give a name to the “flashes” that are seen when the Northern
skies gleam in December. 13. To what is the voice of the skeleton compared?
14. Is it an apt comparison? 15. Does the second stanza prepare
us for a story of happy things? 16. What stanzas help you to see the kind
of people the Vikings were, and to imagine the life they led? 17. The
Viking showed his wonderful courage in going out into the “open main” in
a wild hurricane; give all the other evidences of his courage found in the
poem. 18. The Introduction (pages 89 and 90) gives various motives for

Patrick Spens”? 20. Pronounce the following: daunt; palms; alms; haunt;

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Charles Kingsley (1819-1875), clergyman, lecturer, poet, and
novelist, was born in Dartmoor, England. During his earlier years he lived
in the beautiful Fen Country, the scenery of which made a deep impression
on him. He was a friend of Tennyson and a poet of real excellence. His
ballads, “The Three Fishers” and “The Sands of Dee,” are widely read and
admired, and his novel <cite>Westward Ho!</cite> is a brilliant narrative of adventure.
In “The Three Fishers” he shows that he has studied the fisher folk of his
native country and sees with genuine sympathy their hard life and the
courage that enables them to brave the perils of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. What does the poem tell you about the three fishers?
2. What does it suggest? 3. Where could a stanza be inserted to tell a
part of the story that is only suggested? 4. Do you think this would improve
the poem? 5. What signs were there of an approaching storm?
6. Why does the occupation of deep-sea fishers train them to understand
signs indicating changes in the weather? 7. Why did these fishers go out to
sea notwithstanding signs of a storm? 8. What other thought do you think
was in their minds as “Each thought on the woman who loved him best”?
9. What idea of the deep-sea fishers does this poem give you? 10. What
idea of the sea? 11. What other poems do you know that tell of life on
the sea? 12. What idea of the sea does each give?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Thomas Campbell (1777-1844) was a popular Scottish poet.
He was born in Glasgow, his father being a prominent merchant of that
city. At an early age Campbell began to write poetry, and at twenty-one
had published “The Pleasures of Hope,” a poem that was received with
much favor. He excelled in war poetry, his “Hohenlinden”, “The Battle
of the Baltic”, and “Ye Mariners of England” being the most widely read.
His ballads “Lochiel” and “Lord Ullin’s Daughter” are the best known.
Campbell is remembered not alone for these stirring narrative poems, but
also for the excellence of favorite lines that he wrote, such as “To live in
the hearts we leave behind is not to die,” and “’Tis distance lends enchantment
to the view.”</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Tell briefly the story of the poem. 2. What picture
do the first two stanzas give you? 3. What reason did the boatman give
for saying he would row them over the ferry? 4. What change of time do
you notice in the tenth stanza? 5. What does the eleventh stanza tell
you? 6. Which stanza tells you of the tragedy? 7. What other poems
of the sea have you read in this book? 8. What characteristics of the
ballad has this poem?</p>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> The Indian Mutiny was the great revolt of the
Bengal native army (the Sepoys) against the British rule in 1857. At
Lucknow, in northern India, the English were almost overcome. The town,
defended by a garrison of only 1720 men, who were protecting many
women and children, was besieged by a greatly superior number. The
defense, nevertheless, was maintained from the 30th of June to the 26th of
September, when the relief column under the Scottish general, Sir Henry
Havelock, preceded by the music of the bagpipes, reached the city.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. What stanzas picture Scotland and the feeling her
people have for the music of the bagpipe? 2. What contrasts show how
universal this feeling is? 3. In the first stanza, what is this music said to
be like? 4. What do you know about the bagpipe that makes this comparison
especially apt? 5. The poem tells a story; with what stanzas does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the story begin and end? 6. What relation to this story have the first
two stanzas? 7. What do you know of the Indian Mutiny that helps you
to understand this story? 8. Who first heard the sound of the pipes?
9. How is this accounted for? 10. What did this sound mean to her?
11. Read the stirring lines that give the spirit of the martial music of the
pipes. 12. Why did the piper change to the air “Auld Lang Syne”? What
stanzas picture the feeling of those who heard this music? 13. What people
wear the “tartan”? The “turban”? 14. What is the most interesting point
in the story? 15. Does the story make clear the poet’s reason for saying
that the “sweetest strain” the pipes ever played was at Lucknow?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> John Masefield (1875-⸺) is an English poet and playwright.
When a small boy he had a mania for running away from home; to
satisfy this longing his father sent him to sea when he was fourteen years
old, in charge of the captain of a sailing vessel. During his travels he
collected much material which he afterward used in his poems. On one
of his trips he landed in New York City, where he acquired considerable
knowledge of American customs. Next to Kipling he is England’s greatest
singer of her “Seven Seas and Five Oceans.”</p>

<p>Early in 1916 Masefield came to the United States on a lecture tour
which aroused much interest in him and his writings. During the recent
World War he served in France in connection with the Red Cross. He
also served in the campaign on the Gallipoli Peninsula and wrote a splendid
account of that unfortunate undertaking.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Who is addressed in the first stanza? 2. What comparison
do you find in this stanza? 3. Tell the story in your own words. 4. Where
was the treasure secured? 5. What marks of the ballad do you find in this

<h4>A DESCENT INTO THE MAELSTROM</h4>

<p class="author">EDGAR ALLAN POE</p>

<h5>MY FIRST VIEW OF THE MAELSTROM</h5>

<p>We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag. For
some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to
speak.</p>

<p>“Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided
you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but, about
three years past, there happened to me an event such as never
happened before to mortal man—or at least such as no man ever
survived to tell of—and the six hours of deadly terror which I
then endured have broken me up, body and soul. You suppose
me a <em>very</em> old man—but I am not. It took less than a single day
to change these hairs from a jetty black to white, to weaken my
limbs, and to unstring my nerves, so that I tremble at the least
exertion, and am frightened at a shadow. Do you know I can
scarcely look over this little cliff without getting giddy?”</p>

<p>The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown
himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung
over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
elbow on its extreme and slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose,
a <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref393">sheer unobstructed precipice</a> of black shining rock, some fifteen
or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us.
Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of
its brink. In truth, so deeply was I excited by the perilous position
of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the ground,
clung to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward
at the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea
that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from
the fury of the winds. It was long before I could reason myself
into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.</p>

<p>“You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have
brought you here that you might have the best possible view of
the scene of that event I mentioned—and to tell you the whole
story with the spot just under your eye.</p>

<p>“We are now,” he continued, in that <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref394">particularizing manner</a>
which distinguished him—“we are now close upon the Norwegian
coast—in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the great province
of Nordland—and in the dreary district of Lofoden. The
mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the Cloudy. Now
raise yourself up a little higher—hold on to the grass if you feel
giddy—so—and look out, beyond the belt of vapor beneath us,
into the sea.”</p>

<p>I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose
waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the
Nubian geographer’s account of the <i lang="la">Mare Tenebrarum</i>. A panorama
more <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref395">deplorably desolate</a> no human imagination can conceive.
To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach, there
lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of horridly
black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was but the
more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against
it, its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever. Just
opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed, and
at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was visible
a small, bleak-looking island; or, more properly, its position was
discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
About two miles nearer the land arose another of smaller
size, hideously craggy and barren, and encompassed at various
intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.</p>

<p>The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more
distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it.
Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward
that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed try-sail,
and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there
was here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick,
angry cross-dashing of water in every direction—as well in the
teeth of the wind as otherwise. Of foam there was little except
in the immediate vicinity of the rocks.</p>

<p>“The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called
by the Norwegians Vurrgh. The one midway is Moskoe. That
a mile to the northward is Ambaaren. Yonder are Iflesen, Hoeyholm,
Kieldholm, Suarven, and Buckholm. Farther off—between
Moskoe and Vurrgh—are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and
Skarholm. These are the true names of the places—but why it
had been thought necessary to name them at all is more than
either you or I can understand. Do you hear anything? Do you
see any change in the water?”</p>

<p>We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen,
to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that
we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us
from the summit. As the old man spoke, I became aware of a
loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast
herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same
moment I perceived that what seamen term the <em>chopping</em> character
of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which
set to the eastward. Even while I gazed, this current acquired a
monstrous velocity. Each moment added to its speed—to its
headlong impetuosity. In five minutes the whole sea, as far as
Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between
Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway. Here
the vast bed of the waters, seamed and scarred into a thousand
conflicting channels, burst suddenly into frenzied convulsion—heaving,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
boiling, hissing—gyrating in gigantic and innumerable
vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with
a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes, except in <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref396">precipitous
descents</a>.</p>

<p>In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another
radical alteration. The general surface grew somewhat more
smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while prodigious
streaks of foam became apparent where none had been
seen before. These streaks, at length, spreading out to a great
distance, and entering into combination, took unto themselves
the gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to
form the germ of another more vast. Suddenly—very suddenly—this
assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more
than a mile in diameter. The edge of the whirl was represented
by a broad belt of <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref397">gleaming spray</a>; but no particle of this slipped
into the mouth of the <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref398">terrific funnel</a>, whose interior, as far as the
eye could fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of
water, inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five
degrees, speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and
sweltering motion, and sending forth to the winds an appalling
voice, half shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract
of Niagara ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.</p>

<p>The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked.
I threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in
an excess of nervous agitation.</p>

<p>“This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this <em>can</em> be nothing
else than the great whirlpool of the Maelstrom.”</p>

<p>“So it is sometimes termed,” said he. “We Norwegians call it
the Moskoe-strom, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”</p>

<p>The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared
me for what I saw. That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps
the most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception
either of the magnificence or of the horror of the scene—or
of the wild bewildering sense of <em>the novel</em> which confounds the
beholder. I am not sure from what point of view the writer in
question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have
been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may be
quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly feeble
in conveying an impression of the spectacle.</p>

<p>“Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the
water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other
side, toward Ver (Vurrgh), this depth decreases so as not to afford
a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of splitting on
the rocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it
is flood, the stream runs up the country between Lofoden and
Moskoe with a <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref399">boisterous rapidity</a>; but the roar of its impetuous
ebb to the sea is scarce equaled by the loudest and most dreadful
cataracts, the noise being heard several leagues off; and the vortices
or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship comes
within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried down
to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks; and
when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up again.
But these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the
ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an
hour, its violence gradually returning. When the stream is most
boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to
come within a Norwegian mile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships
have been carried away by not guarding against it before they
were within its reach. It likewise happens frequently that whales
come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence;
and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings
in their <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref400">fruitless struggles</a> to disengage themselves. A bear once,
attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the
stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be
heard on shore. Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after being
absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to such a
degree as if bristles grew upon them. This plainly shows the
bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are whirled
to and fro. This stream is regulated by the <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref401">flux and reflux</a> of the
sea—it being constantly high and low water every six hours.
In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it
raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of
the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this
could have been ascertained at all in the <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref402">immediate vicinity</a> of
the vortex. The “forty fathoms” must have reference only to
portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe or
Lofoden. The depth in the center of the Moskoe-strom must be
immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is necessary
than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance into the
<a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref403">abyss of the whirl</a> which may be had from the highest crag of
Helseggen. Looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling
Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the simplicity with
which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a matter difficult of
belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the bears; for it appeared
to me, in fact, a self-evident thing that the largest ships of the
line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly
attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and
must disappear bodily and at once.</p>

<p>The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which,
I remember, seemed to me sufficiently <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref404">plausible in perusal</a>—now
wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect. The idea generally
received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among
the Faroe Islands, “have no other cause than the <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref405">collision of
waves</a> rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks
and shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself
like a cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper
must the fall be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or
vortex, the prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by
lesser experiments.”—These are the words of the <cite>Encyclopedia
Britannica</cite>. Kircher and others imagine that in the center of
the channel of the Maelstrom is an abyss penetrating the globe,
and issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia being
somewhat decidedly named in one instance. This opinion, idle
in itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most
readily assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather
surprised to hear him say that, although it was the view almost
universally entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it
nevertheless was not his own. As to the former notion he confessed
his inability to comprehend it; and here I agreed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
him—for, however conclusive on paper, it becomes altogether
unintelligible, and even absurd, amid the thunder of the abyss.</p>

<h5>THE GUIDE’S MARVELOUS TALE</h5>

<p>“You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old
man, “and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee,
and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will
convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-strom.”</p>

<p>I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.</p>

<p>“Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged
smack of about seventy tons burden, with which we were in the
habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to
Vurrgh. In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at
proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it;
but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen we three were
the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the
islands, as I tell you. The usual grounds are a great way lower
down to the southward. There fish can be got at all hours, without
much risk, and therefore these places are preferred. The
choice spots over here among the rocks, however, not only yield
the finest variety, but in far greater abundance; so that we often
got in a single day what the more timid of the craft could not
scrape together in a week. In fact, we made it a matter of
<a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref406">desperate speculation</a>—the risk of life standing instead of labor,
and courage answering for capital.</p>

<p>“We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the
coast than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather, to take
advantage of the fifteen minutes’ slack to push across the main
channel of the Moskoe-strom, far above the pool, and then drop
down upon anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen,
where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere. Here we used
to remain until nearly time for slack water again, when we weighed
and made for home. We never set out upon this expedition without
a steady side wind for going and coming—one that we felt
sure would not fail us before our return—and we seldom made a
miscalculation upon this point. Twice, during six years, we were
forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
is a rare thing indeed just about here; and once we had to remain
on the ground nearly a week, starving to death, owing to a gale
which blew up shortly after our arrival, and made the channel
too boisterous to be thought of. Upon this occasion we should
have been driven out to sea in spite of everything (for the whirlpools
threw us round and round so violently that, at length, we
fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it had not been that we
drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents—here today
and gone tomorrow—which drove us under the lee of Flimen,
where, by good luck, we brought up.</p>

<p>“I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we
encountered ‘on the ground’—it is a bad spot to be in, even in
good weather—but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of
the Moskoe-strom itself without accident; although at times my
heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute
or so behind or before the slack. The wind sometimes was not as
strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less
way than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack
unmanageable. My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old,
and I had two stout boys of my own. These would have been
of great assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as
afterward in fishing—but, somehow, although we ran the risk
ourselves, we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the
danger—for, after all said and done, it <em>was</em> a horrible danger, and
that is the truth.</p>

<p>“It is now within a few days of three years since what I am
going to tell you occurred. It was on the tenth of July, 18—, a
day which the people of this part of the world will never forget—for
it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever
came out of the heavens. And yet all the morning, and indeed
until late in the afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze
from the southwest, while the sun shone brightly, so that the
oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to
follow.</p>

<p>“The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed
over to the islands about two o’clock <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, and soon nearly loaded
the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
that day than we had ever known them. It was just seven, <em>by my
watch</em>, when we weighed and started for home, so as to make
the worst of the Strom at slack water, which we knew would be
at eight.</p>

<p>“We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and
for some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of
danger, for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it.
All at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen.
This was most unusual—something that had never happened to
us before—and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly
knowing why: We put the boat on the wind, but could make no
headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing
to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw
the whole horizon covered with a singular copper-covered cloud
that rose with the most amazing velocity.</p>

<p>“In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away,
and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction.
This state of things, however, did not last long enough to give
us time to think about it. In less than a minute the storm was
upon us—in less than two the sky was entirely overcast—and
what with this and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark
that we could not see each other in the smack.</p>

<p>“Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.
The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced anything
like it. We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly
took us; but, at the first puff, both our masts went by the board
as if they had been sawed off—the mainmast taking with it my
youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.</p>

<p>“Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat
so upon water. It had a complete flush deck, with only a small
hatch near the bow, and this hatch it had always been our
custom to batten down when about to cross the Strom, by way
of precaution against the chopping seas. But for this circumstance
we should have foundered at once—for we lay entirely
buried for some moments. How my elder brother escaped destruction
I cannot say, for I never had an opportunity of ascertaining.
For my part, as soon as I had let the foresail run, I threw myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
flat on deck, with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the
bow, and with my hands grasping a ringbolt near the foot of
the foremast. It was mere instinct that prompted me to do
this—which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could have
done—for I was too much flurried to think.</p>

<h5>SWEPT INTO THE MAELSTROM</h5>

<p>“For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and
all this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt. When I
could stand it no longer I raised myself upon my knees, still
keeping hold with my hands, and thus got my head clear.
Presently our little boat gave herself a shake, just as a dog
does in coming out of the water, and thus rid herself, in some
measure, of the seas. I was now trying to get the better of the
stupor that had come over me, and to collect my senses so as to
see what was to be done, when I felt somebody grasp my arm.
It was my elder brother, and my heart leaped for joy, for I
had made sure that he was overboard—but the next moment all
this joy was turned into horror—for he put his mouth close to
my ear, and screamed out the word ‘<em>Moskoe-strom!</em>’</p>

<p>“No one will ever know what my feelings were at that moment.
I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit
of the ague. I knew what he meant by that one word well
enough—I knew what he wished to make me understand. With
the wind that now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of
the Strom, and nothing could save us!</p>

<p>“You perceive that in crossing the Strom <em>channel</em>, we always
went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather,
and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack—but
now we were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a
hurricane as this! ‘To be sure,’ I thought, ‘we shall get there
just about the slack—there is some little hope in that’—but in
the next moment I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to
dream of hope at all. I knew very well that we were doomed,
had we been ten times a ninety-gun ship.</p>

<p>“By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself,
or perhaps we did not feel it so much as we scudded before it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
but at all events the seas, which at first had been kept down
by the wind, and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute
mountains. A singular change, too, had come over the heavens.
Around in every direction it was still black as pitch, but nearly
overhead there burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear
sky—as clear as I ever saw—and of a deep bright blue—and
through it there blazed forth the full moon with a luster that I
never before knew her to wear. She lit up everything about us
with the greatest distinctness—but, oh, God, what a scene it was
to light up!</p>

<p>“I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother—but,
in some manner which I could not understand, the din had
so increased that I could not make him hear a single word,
although I screamed at the top of my voice in his ear. Presently
he shook his head, looking as pale as death, and held up one of
his fingers, as if to say <em>listen</em>!</p>

<p>“At first I could not make out what he meant—but soon a
hideous thought flashed upon me. I dragged my watch from its
fob. It was not going. I glanced at its face by the moonlight,
and then burst into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean.
<em>It had run down at seven o’clock! We were behind the time of
the slack, and the whirl of the Strom was in full fury!</em></p>

<p>“When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep
laden, the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem
always to slip from beneath her—which appears very strange to
a landsman—and this is what is called <em>riding</em>, in sea phrase.</p>

<p>“Well, so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but
presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the
counter, and bore us with it as it rose—up—up—as if into the
sky. I would not have believed that any wave could rise so high.
And then down we came with a sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that
made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I was falling from some lofty
mountain-top in a dream. But while we were up I had thrown
a quick glance around—and that one glance was all-sufficient.
I saw our exact position in an instant. The Moskoe-strom whirlpool
was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no more
like the everyday Moskoe-strom than the whirl as you now see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
it is like a mill-race. If I had not known where we were, and
what we had to expect, I should not have recognized the place
at all. As it was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror. The
lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm.</p>

<p>“It could not have been more than two minutes afterwards
until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped
in foam. The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then
shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt. At the same
moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned
in a kind of shrill shriek—such a sound as you might imagine
given out by the water-pipes of many thousand steam vessels,
letting off their steam all together. We were now in the belt of
surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course,
that another moment would plunge us into the abyss—down
which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing
velocity with which we were borne along. The boat did not seem
to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon
the surface of the surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl,
and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left. It
stood like a huge, writhing wall between us and the horizon.</p>

<p>“It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very
jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only
approaching it. Having made up my mind to hope no more, I
got rid of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.
I suppose it was despair that strung my nerves.</p>

<p>“It may look like boasting—but what I tell you is truth—I
began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a
manner, and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration
as my own individual life, in view of so wonderful a
manifestation of God’s power. I do believe that I blushed with
shame when this idea crossed my mind. After a little while I
became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl
itself. I positively felt a <em>wish</em> to explore its depths, even at the
sacrifice I was going to make; and my principal grief was that
I should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about
the mysteries I should see. These, no doubt, were singular fancies
to occupy a man’s mind in such extremity—and I have often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
thought since, that the revolutions of the boat around the pool
might have rendered me a little light-headed.</p>

<p>“There was another circumstance which tended to restore my
self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which
could not reach us in our present situation—for, as you saw
yourself, the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general
bed of the ocean, and this latter now towered above us, a high,
black, mountainous ridge. If you have never been at sea in a
heavy gale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind
occasioned by the wind and spray together. They blind, deafen,
and strangle you, and take away all power of action or reflection.
But we were now, in a great measure, rid of these annoyances—just
as death-condemned felons in prisons are allowed
petty indulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain.</p>

<p>“How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible
to say. We careered round and round for perhaps an hour,
flying rather than floating, getting gradually more and more into
the middle of the surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible
inner edge. All this time I had never let go of the ringbolt.
My brother was at the stern, holding on to a small empty water-cask
which had been securely lashed under the coop of the
counter, and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept
overboard when the gale first took us. As we approached the
brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the
ring, from which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to
force my hands, as it was not large enough to afford us both a
secure grasp. I never felt deeper grief than when I saw him
attempt this act—although I knew he was a madman when he
did it—a raving maniac through sheer fright. I did not care,
however, to contest the point with him. I knew it could make
no difference whether either of us held on at all; so I let him
have the bolt, and went astern to the cask. This there was no
great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily enough,
and upon an even keel—only swaying to and fro, with the
immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl. Scarcely had I
secured myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
to starboard, and rushed headlong into the abyss. I muttered a
hurried prayer to God, and thought all was over.</p>

<p>“As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively
tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes.
For some seconds I dared not open them—while I expected
instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my
death-struggles with the water. But moment after moment
elapsed. I still lived. The sense of falling had ceased; and the
motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while
in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more
along. I took courage and looked once again upon the scene.</p>

<p>“Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and
admiration with which I gazed about me. The boat appeared
to be hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon the interior
surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in depth,
and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for
ebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun
around, and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot
forth, as the rays of the full moon, from that circular rift amid
the clouds which I have already described, streamed in a <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref407">flood
of golden glory</a> along the black walls, and far away down into
the inmost recesses of the abyss.</p>

<p>“At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.
The general burst of <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref408">terrific grandeur</a> was all that I
beheld. When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell
instinctively downward. In this direction I was able to obtain
an unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung
on the inclined surface of the pool. She was quite upon an even
keel—that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that
of the water—but this latter sloped at an angle of more than
forty-five degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our
beam-ends. I could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had
scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in
this situation, than if we had been upon a dead level; and this,
I suppose, was owing to the speed at which we revolved.</p>

<p>“The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of
the profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped,
and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that
narrow and tottering bridge which Mussulmans say is the only
pathway between Time and Eternity. This mist, or spray, was
no doubt occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the
funnel, as they all met together at the bottom—but the yell that
went up to the heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt
to describe.</p>

<p>“Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam
above, had carried us to a great distance down the slope; but
our farther descent was by no means proportionate. Round and
round we swept—not with any uniform movement, but in dizzying
swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred
yards—sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl. Our
progress downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very
perceptible.</p>

<h5>THE MARVELOUS ESCAPE</h5>

<p>“Looking about me upon the <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref409">wide waste of liquid ebony</a> on
which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the
only object in the embrace of the whirl. Both above and below
us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building
timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as
pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels, and staves. I
have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken
the place of my original terrors. It appeared to grow upon me
as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. I now began
to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated
in our company. I <em>must</em> have been delirious—for I even sought
<em>amusement</em> in speculating upon the relative velocities of their
several descents toward the foam below. ‘This fir tree,’ I found
myself at one time saying, ‘will certainly be the next thing that
takes the awful plunge and disappears,’—and then I was disappointed
to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook
it and went down before. At length, after making several
guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all—this fact—the
fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat
heavily once more.</p>

<p>“It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn
of a more exciting <em>hope</em>. This hope arose partly from memory,
and partly from present observation. I called to mind the great
variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden,
having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-strom.
By far the greater number of the articles were shattered
in the most extraordinary way—so chafed and roughened as to
have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters—but then
I distinctly recollected that there were <em>some</em> of them which were
not disfigured at all. Now I could not account for this difference
except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the
only ones which had been <em>completely absorbed</em>—that the others
had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide, or, from
some reason, had descended so slowly after entering, that they
did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came, or
of the ebb, as the case might be. I conceived it possible, in
either instance, that they might thus be whirled up again to the
level of the ocean, without undergoing the fate of those which
had been drawn in more early or absorbed more rapidly. I made,
also, three important observations. The first was, that as a
general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their
descent; the second, that, between two masses of equal extent,
the one spherical, and the other <em>of any other shape</em>, the superiority
in speed of descent was with the sphere; the third, that,
between two masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the
other of any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more
slowly. Since my escape, I have had several conversations on
this subject with an old schoolmaster of the district; and it was
from him that I learned the use of the words ‘cylinder’ and
‘sphere.’ He explained to me—although I have forgotten the
explanation—how what I observed was, in fact, the natural consequence
of the forms of the floating fragments, and showed me
how it happened that a cylinder, swimming in a vortex, offered
more resistance to its suction, and was drawn in with greater
difficulty, than an equally bulky body, of any form whatever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“There was one startling circumstance which went a great
way in enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious
to turn them to account, and this was that, at every revolution,
we passed something like a barrel, or else the yard or mast of
a vessel, while many of these things, which had been on our
level when I first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the
whirlpool, were now high up above us, and seemed to have moved
but little from their original station.</p>

<p>“I no longer hesitated what to do. I resolved to lash myself
securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it
loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the
water. I attracted my brother’s attention to signs, pointed to
the floating barrels that came near us, and did everything in
my power to make him understand what I was about to do. I
thought at length that he comprehended my design—but, whether
this was the case or not, he shook his head despairingly, and
refused to move from his station by the ringbolt. It was impossible
to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and so,
with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself
to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the
counter, and precipitated myself with it into the sea, without
another moment’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be.
As it is myself who now tells you this tale—as you see that I
<em>did</em> escape—and as you are already in possession of the mode
in which this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate
all that I have further to say—I will bring my story quickly to
conclusion. It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after
my quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance
beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid
succession, and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong,
at once and forever, into the chaos of foam below. The
barrel to which I was attached sunk very little farther than
half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot
at which I leaped overboard, before a great change took place
in the character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the
vast funnel became momently less and less steep. <a href="#phrases39" title="List of phrases" id="ref410">The gyrations
of the whirl</a> grew, gradually, less and less violent. By degrees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of the
gulf seemed slowly to uprise. The sky was clear, the winds had
gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west,
when I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view
of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of
the Moskoe-strom <em>had been</em>. It was the hour of the slack; but
the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the
hurricane. I was borne violently into the channel of the strom,
and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the
‘grounds’ of the fishermen. A boat picked me up—exhausted
from fatigue—and (now that the danger was removed) speechless
from the memory of its horror. Those who drew me on board
were my old mates and daily companions, but they knew me
no more than they would have known a traveler from the spirit-land.
My hair, which had been raven-black the day before,
was as white as you see it now. They say, too, that the whole
expression of my countenance had changed. I told them my
story—they did not believe it. I now tell it to you—and I can
scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry
fishermen of Lofoden.”</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was the greatest poet and
short story writer the South has produced. His parents belonged by
profession to the stage; his mother was English and his father American
by birth. Born in Boston, he was left an orphan at an early age, and was
adopted by a Mr. Allan, a wealthy citizen of Richmond, Virginia. Poe was
sent to school in London, and later he attended the University of Virginia,
and the military academy at West Point. Mr. Allan lavished money and
other inducements upon him in vain efforts to get him to settle down to a
permanent profession, but finally abandoned him to his own resources.
From that time on, Poe eked out a living by publishing poems and tales,
by contributions to newspapers and magazines, and by editorial work. But
he was too erratic in his habits to retain long either positions or friends.
His writings, like his character, were weird, mysterious, haunted by brooding
melancholy. But his poetry is perhaps the most purely musical of any in
our language—for Poe believed that poetry should be the language of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
feelings rather than of thought, and that it should therefore seek to produce
its effects through “harmony of sweet sounds” rather than through the meaning
of its lines. His prose tales of mystery and adventure are remarkable
for their imaginative and poetic style; they have served as models for many
well known writers. Poe was the originator of the modern short story.</p>

<p>Poe’s erratic, troubled life ended at Baltimore, in 1849, in the fortieth
year of his age. The pathos of it is well summed up in the inscription on
a memorial tablet erected to him in the New York Museum of Art: “He
was great in his genius, unhappy in his life, wretched in his death, but in
his fame, immortal.”</p>

<h4>THE WRECK OF THE GOLDEN MARY</h4>

<p class="author">CHARLES DICKENS</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Chapter I—The Wreck</span></h5>

<h6>RAVENDER TAKES COMMAND OF THE GOLDEN MARY</h6>

<p>I was apprenticed to the Sea when I was twelve years old,
and I have encountered a great deal of rough weather, both <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref411">literal
and metaphorical</a>. It has always been my opinion since I first
possessed such a thing as an opinion, that the man who knows
only one subject is next tiresome to the man who knows no subject.
Therefore, in the course of my life I have taught myself
whatever I could, and although I am not an educated man, I am
able, I am thankful to say, to have an intelligent interest in most
things.</p>

<p>A person might suppose, from reading the above, that I am in
the habit of holding forth about number one. That is not the
case. Just as if I were to come into a room among strangers, and
must either be introduced or introduce myself, so I have taken
the liberty of passing these few remarks, simply and plainly that
it may be known who and what I am. I will add no more of the
sort than that my name is William George Ravender, that I was
born at Penrith half a year after my own father was drowned,
and that I am on the second day of this present blessed Christmas
week of one thousand eight hundred and fifty-six, fifty-six years
of age.</p>

<p>When the rumor first went flying up and down that there was
gold in California—which, as most people know, was before it was
discovered in the British colony of Australia—I was in the West
Indies, trading among the Islands. Being in command and likewise
part-owner of a smart schooner, I had my work cut out for
me, and I was doing it. Consequently, gold in California was no
business of mine.</p>

<p>But, by the time when I came home to England again, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
thing was as clear as your hand held up before you at noon-day.
There was Californian gold in the museums and in the goldsmiths’
shops, and the very first time I went upon ’Change, I met a friend
of mine (a seafaring man like myself), with a Californian nugget
hanging to his watch-chain. I handled it. It was as like a peeled
walnut with bits unevenly broken off here and there, and then
electrotyped all over, as ever I saw anything in my life.</p>

<p>I am a single man (she was too good for this world and for
me, and she died six weeks before our marriage-day), so when I
am ashore, I live in my house at Poplar. My house at Poplar
is taken care of and kept ship-shape by an old lady who was my
mother’s maid before I was born. She is as handsome and as
upright as any old lady in the world. She is as fond of me as if
she had ever had an only son, and I were he. Well do I know
wherever I sail that she never lays down her head at night without
having said, “Merciful Lord! bless and preserve William
George Ravender, and send him safe home, through Christ our
Savior!” I have thought of it in many a <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref412">dangerous moment</a>,
when it has done me no harm, I am sure.</p>

<p>In my house at Poplar, along with this old lady, I lived quiet
for the best part of a year, having had a long spell of it among the
Islands, and having (which was very uncommon in me) taken
the fever rather badly. At last, being strong and hearty, and having
read every book I could lay hold of right out, I was walking
down Leadenhall Street in the City of London, thinking of turning-to
again, when I met what I call Smithick and Watersby of
Liverpool. I chanced to lift up my eyes from looking in at a
<a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref413">ship’s chronometer</a> in a window, and I saw him bearing down
upon me, head on.</p>

<p>It is, personally, neither Smithick, nor Watersby, that I here
mention, nor was I ever acquainted with any man of either of
those names, nor do I think that there has been any one of either
of those names in that Liverpool House for years back. But, it
is in reality the House itself that I refer to; and a wiser merchant
or a truer gentleman never stepped.</p>

<p>“My dear Captain Ravender,” says he. “Of all the men on
earth, I wanted to see you most. I was on my way to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well!” says I. “That looks as if you <em>were</em> to see me, don’t
it?” With that I put my arm in his, and we walked on toward
the Royal Exchange, and when we got there, walked up and down
at the back of it where the Clock-Tower is. We walked an hour
and more, for he had much to say to me. He had a scheme for
chartering a new ship of their own to take out cargo to the diggers
and emigrants in California, and to buy and bring back gold.
Into the particulars of that scheme I will not enter, and I have no
right to enter. All I say of it is, that it was a very original one,
a very fine one, a very sound one, and a very <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref414">lucrative one</a> beyond
doubt.</p>

<p>He imparted it to me as freely as if I had been a part of himself.
After doing so, he made me the handsomest sharing offer
that ever was made to me, boy or man—or I believe to any other
captain in the Merchant Navy—and he took this round turn to
finish with:</p>

<p>“Ravender, you are well aware that the lawlessness of that
coast and country at present is as special as the circumstances
in which it is placed. Crews of vessels outward bound desert
as soon as they make the land; crews of vessels homeward bound,
ship at enormous wages, with the express intention of murdering
the captain and seizing the gold freight; no man can trust another,
and the devil seems let loose. Now,” says he, “you know my
opinion of you, and you know I am only expressing it, and with
no singularity, when I tell you that you are almost the only man
on whose integrity, discretion, and energy—” etc., etc. For I
don’t want to repeat what he said, though I was and am sensible
of it.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my being, as I have mentioned, quite ready
for a voyage, still I had some doubts of this voyage. Of course
I knew, without being told, that there were peculiar difficulties
and dangers in it, a long way over and above those which attend
all voyages. It must not be supposed that I was afraid to face
them; but, in my opinion a man has no manly motive or sustainment
in his own breast for facing dangers, unless he has well considered
what they are, and is quietly able to say to himself, “None
of these perils can now take me by surprise; I shall know what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
do for the best in any of them; all the rest lies in the higher and
greater hands to which I humbly commit myself.” On this principle
I have so attentively considered (regarding it as my duty)
all the hazards I have ever been able to think of, in the ordinary
way of storm, shipwreck, and fire at sea, that I hope I should be
prepared to do in any of those cases whatever could be done, to
save the lives entrusted to my charge.</p>

<p>As I was thoughtful, my good friend proposed that he should
leave me to walk there as long as I liked, and that I should dine
with him by-and-by at his club in Pall Mall. I accepted the
invitation and I walked up and down there, quarter-deck fashion,
a matter of a couple of hours; now and then looking up at the
weathercock as I might have looked up aloft; and now and then
taking a look into Cornhill, as I might have taken a look over
the side.</p>

<p>All dinner-time, and all after dinner-time, we talked it over
again. I gave him my views of his plan, and he very much
approved of the same. I told him I had nearly decided, but not
quite. “Well, well,” says he, “come down to Liverpool tomorrow
with me, and see the Golden Mary.” I liked the name (her name
was Mary, and she was golden, if golden stands for good), so I
began to feel that it was almost done when I said I would go to
Liverpool. On the next morning but one we were on board the
Golden Mary. I might have known, from his asking me to come
down and see her, what she was. I declare her to have been the
completest and most exquisite Beauty that ever I set my eyes
upon.</p>

<p>We had inspected every timber in her, and had come back to
the gangway to go ashore from the dock-basin, when I put out my
hand to my friend. “Touch upon it,” says I, “and touch heartily.
I take command of this ship and I am hers and yours, if I can
get John Steadiman for my chief mate.”</p>

<p>John Steadiman had sailed with me four voyages. The first
voyage John was third mate out to China, and came home second.
The other three voyages he was my first officer. At this time of
chartering the Golden Mary, he was aged thirty-two. A brisk,
bright, blue-eyed fellow, a very neat figure and rather under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
middle size, never out of the way and never in it, a face that
pleased everybody and that all children took to, a habit of going
about singing as cheerily as a blackbird, and a perfect sailor.</p>

<p>We were in one of those Liverpool hackney-coaches in less
than a minute, and we cruised about in her upwards of three
hours, looking for John. John had come home from Van Diemen’s
Land barely a month before, and I had heard of him as taking a
frisk in Liverpool. We asked after him, among many other places,
at the two boarding-houses he was fondest of, and we found he
had had a week’s spell at each of them; but, he had gone here and
gone there, and had set off “to lay out on the main-to’-gallant-yard
of the highest Welsh mountain” (so he had told the people
of the house), and where he might be then, or when he might come
back nobody could tell us. But it was surprising, to be sure, to
see how every face brightened the moment there was mention
made of the name of Mr. Steadiman.</p>

<p>We were taken aback at meeting with no better luck, and we
had wore ship and put her head for my friend’s, when as we were
jogging through the streets, I clap my eyes on John himself coming
out of a toy-shop! He was carrying a little boy, and conducting
two uncommon pretty women to their coach, and he told me
afterwards that he had never in his life seen one of the three
before, but that he was so taken with them on looking in at the
toy-shop while they were buying the child a cranky Noah’s Ark,
very much down by the head, that he had gone in and asked the
ladies’ permission to treat him to a <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref415">tolerably correct</a> Cutter there
was in the window, in order that such a handsome boy might not
grow up with a lubberly idea of naval architecture.</p>

<p>We stood off and on until the ladies’ coachman began to give
way, and then we hailed John. On his coming aboard of us, I told
him, very gravely, what I had said to my friend. It struck him,
as he said himself, amidships. He was quite shaken by it. “Captain
Ravender,” were John Steadiman’s words, “such an opinion
from you is true commendation, and I’ll sail around the world with
you for twenty years if you <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref416">hoist the signal</a>, and stand by you for
ever!” And now indeed I felt that it was done, and that the
Golden Mary was afloat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>Grass never grew yet under the feet of Smithick and Watersby.
The riggers were out of that ship in a fortnight’s time, and we
had begun taking in cargo. John was always aboard, seeing
everything stowed with his own eyes; and whenever I went aboard
myself early or late, whether he was below in the hold, or on deck
at the hatchway, or overhauling his cabin, nailing up pictures in
it of the Blush Roses of England, the Blue Belles of Scotland, and
the female Shamrock of Ireland, of a certainty I heard John singing
like a blackbird.</p>

<h6>THE START FOR CALIFORNIA</h6>

<p>We had room for twenty passengers. Our sailing advertisement
was no sooner out, than we might have taken these twenty
times over. In entering our men, I and John (both together)
picked them, and we entered none but good hands—as good as
were to be found in that port. And so, in a good ship of the best
build, well owned, well arranged, well officered, well manned, well
found in all respects, we parted with our pilot at a quarter past
four o’clock in the afternoon of the seventh of March, one thousand
eight hundred and fifty-one, and stood with a fair wind out
to sea.</p>

<p>It may be easily believed that up to that time I had had no
leisure to be intimate with my passengers. The most of them were
then in their berths seasick; however, in going among them, telling
them what was good for them, persuading them not to be there,
but to come up on deck and feel the breeze, and in rousing them
with a joke, or a comfortable word, I made acquaintance with
them, perhaps, in a more friendly and confidential way from the
first, than I might have done at the cabin table.</p>

<p>Of my passengers, I need only particularize, just at present,
a bright-eyed blooming young wife who was going out to join
her husband in California, taking with her their only child, a little
girl three years old, whom he had never seen; a sedate young
woman in black, some five years older (about thirty as I should
say), who was going out to join a brother; and an old gentleman,
a good deal like a hawk if his eyes had been better and not so red,
who was always talking, morning, noon, and night, about the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
discovery. But, whether he was making the voyage, thinking his
old arms could dig for gold, or whether his speculation was to buy
it, or to barter for it, or to cheat for it, or to snatch it anyhow
from other people, was his secret. He kept his secret.</p>

<p>These three and the child were the soonest well. The child was
a most engaging child, to be sure, and very fond of me; though I
am bound to admit that John Steadiman and I were borne on her
pretty little books in reverse order, and that he was captain there,
and I was mate. It was beautiful to watch her with John, and it
was beautiful to watch John with her. Few would have thought
it possible, to see John playing at Bo-peep round the mast, that
he was the man who had caught up an iron bar and struck a
Malay and a Maltese dead, as they were gliding with their knives
down the cabin stair aboard the bark Old England, when the
captain lay ill in his cot, off Sauger Point. But he was; and give
him his back against a bulwark, he would have done the same by
half a dozen of them. The name of the young mother was Mrs.
Atherfield, the name of the young lady in black was Miss Coleshaw,
and the name of the old gentleman was Mr. Rarx.</p>

<p>As the child had a quantity of shining fair hair, clustering in
curls all around her face, and as her name was Lucy, Steadiman
gave her the name of Golden Lucy. So, we had the Golden Lucy
and the Golden Mary; and John kept up the idea to that extent as
he and the child went playing about the decks, that I believe she
used to think the ship was alive somehow—a sister or companion,
going to the same place as herself. She liked to be by the wheel,
and in fine weather, I have often stood by the man whose trick it
was at the wheel, only to hear her, sitting near my feet, talking
to the ship. Never had a child such a doll before, I suppose; but
she made a doll of the Golden Mary, and used to dress her up by
tying ribbons and little bits of finery to the belaying pins; and
nobody ever moved them, unless it was to save them from being
blown away.</p>

<p>Of course I took charge of the two young women, and I called
them “my dear,” and they never minded, knowing that whatever
I said was said in a fatherly and protecting spirit. I gave them
their places on each side of me at dinner, Mrs. Atherfield on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
right and Miss Coleshaw on my left; and I directed the unmarried
lady to serve out the breakfast, and the married lady to serve out
the tea. Likewise I said to my black steward in their presence,
“Tom Snow, these two ladies are equally the mistresses of this
house, and do you obey their orders equally”; at which Tom
laughed, and they all laughed.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Rarx was not a pleasant man to look at, nor yet to
talk to, or to be with, for no one could help seeing that he was a
sordid and selfish character, and that he had warped further and
further out of the straight with time. Not but what he was on his
best behavior with us, as everybody was; for we had no bickering
among us, for’ard or aft. I only mean to say, he was not the man
one would have chosen for a messmate. If choice there had been,
one might even have gone a few points out of one’s course to say,
“No! Not him!” But, there was one <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref417">curious inconsistency</a> in
Mr. Rarx. That was, that he took an astonishing interest in the
child. He looked, and I may add, he was, one of the last men to
care at all for a child, or care much for any human creature.
Still, he went so far as to be habitually uneasy, if the child was
long on deck, out of his sight. He was always afraid of her falling
overboard, or falling down a hatchway, or of a block or what not
coming down upon her from the rigging in the working of the ship,
or of her getting some hurt or other. He used to look at her and
touch her, as if she was something precious to him. He was
always solicitous about her not injuring her health, and constantly
entreated her mother to be careful of it. This was so much the
more curious, because the child did not like him, but used to shrink
away from him, and would not even put out her hand to him without
coaxing from others. I believe that every soul on board frequently
noticed this, and not one of us understood it. However,
it was such a plain fact, that John Steadiman said more than
once when old Mr. Rarx was not within earshot, that if the
Golden Mary felt a tenderness for the dear old gentleman she
carried in her lap, she must be bitterly jealous of the Golden
Lucy.</p>

<p>Before I go any further with this narrative, I will state that
our ship was a bark of three hundred tons, carrying a crew of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
eighteen men, a second mate in addition to John, a carpenter, an
armorer or smith, and two apprentices (one a Scotch boy, poor
little fellow). We had three boats; the Long-boat, capable of
carrying twenty-five men; the Cutter, capable of carrying fifteen;
and the Surf-boat, capable of carrying ten. I put down the capacity
of these boats according to the numbers they were really meant
to hold.</p>

<p>We had tastes of bad weather and head-winds, of course; but,
on the whole, we had as fine a run as any reasonable man could
expect, for sixty days. I then began to enter two remarks in the
ship’s Log and in my Journal; first, that there was an unusual and
amazing quantity of ice; second, that the nights were most wonderfully
dark in spite of the ice.</p>

<p>For five days and a half, it seemed quite useless and hopeless
to alter the ship’s course so as to stand out of the way of this ice.
I made what southing I could; but, all that time, we were beset
by it. Mrs. Atherfield, after standing by me on deck once, looking
for some time in an awed manner at the great bergs that surrounded
us, said in a whisper, “Oh! Captain Ravender, it looks as
if the whole solid earth had changed into ice, and broken up!”
I said to her, laughing, “I don’t wonder that it does, to your
inexperienced eyes, my dear.” But I had never seen a twentieth
part of the quantity, and, in reality, I was pretty much of her
opinion.</p>

<p>However, at two <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span> on the afternoon of the sixth day, that
is to say, when we were sixty-six days out, John Steadiman, who
had gone aloft, sang out from the top, that the sea was clear
ahead. Before four <span class="smcapuc">P. M.</span> a strong breeze springing up right astern,
we were in open water at sunset. The breeze then freshening into
half a gale of wind, and the Golden Mary being a very fast sailer,
we went before the wind merrily, all night.</p>

<p>I had thought it impossible that it could be darker than it had
been, until the sun, moon, and stars should fall out of the Heavens,
and Time should be destroyed; but, it had been next to light, in
comparison with what it was now. The darkness was so profound,
that looking into it was painful and oppressive—like looking,
without a ray of light, into a dense black bandage put as close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
before the eyes as it could be, without touching them. I doubled
the lookout, and John and I stood in the bow side-by-side, never
leaving it all night. Yet I should no more have known that he was
near me when he was silent, without putting out my arm and
touching him, than I should if he had turned in and been fast
asleep below. We were not so much looking out, all of us, as
listening to the utmost, both with our eyes and ears.</p>

<p>Next day, I found that the mercury in the barometer, which
had risen steadily since we cleared the ice, remained steady.
I had had very good observations, with now and then the interruption
of a day or so, since our departure. I got the sun at noon,
and found that we were in Lat. 58° S., Long. 60° W., off New
South Shetland; in the neighborhood of Cape Horn. We were
sixty-seven days out, that day. The ship’s reckoning was accurately
worked and made up. The ship did her duty admirably,
all on board were well, and all hands were as smart, efficient, and
contented as it was possible to be.</p>

<p>When the night came on again as dark as before, it was the
eighth night I had been on deck. Nor had I taken more than a
very little sleep in the daytime, my station being always near the
helm, and often at it, while we were among the ice. Few but those
who have tried it can imagine the difficulty and pain of only keeping
the eyes open—physically open—under such circumstances, in
such darkness. They get struck by the darkness, and blinded by
the darkness. They make patterns in it, and they flash in it, as
if they had gone out of your head to look at you. On the turn of
midnight, John Steadiman, who was alert and fresh (for I had
always made him turn in by day), said to me, “Captain Ravender,
I entreat of you to go below. I am sure you can hardly stand, and
your voice is getting weak, sir. Go below, and take a little rest.
I’ll call you if <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref418">a block chafes</a>.” I said to John in answer, “Well,
well, John! Let us wait till the turn of one o’clock, before we
talk about that.” I had just had one of the ship’s lanterns held
up, that I might see how the night went by my watch, and it was
then twenty minutes after twelve.</p>

<p>At five minutes before one, John sang out to the boy to bring
the lantern again, and when I told him once more what the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was, entreated and prayed of me to go below. “Captain Ravender,”
says he, “all’s well; we can’t afford to have you laid up for
a single hour; and I respectfully and earnestly beg of you to go
below.” The end of it was, that I agreed to do so, on the understanding
that if I failed to come up of my own accord within three
hours, I was to be punctually called. Having settled that, I left
John in charge. But I called him to me once afterwards, to ask
him a question. I had been to look at the barometer, and had
seen the mercury still perfectly steady, and had come up the companion
again to take a last look about me—if I can use such a
word in reference to such darkness—when I thought that the
waves, as the Golden Mary parted them and shook them off, had a
hollow sound in them; something that I fancied was a rather unusual
reverberation. I was standing by the quarterdeck rail on
the starboard side, when I called John aft to me, and bade him
listen. He did so with the greatest attention. Turning to me
he then said, “Rely upon it, Captain Ravender, you have been
without rest too long, and the novelty is only in the state of your
sense of hearing.” I thought so too by that time, and I think so
now, though I can never know for absolute certain in this world,
whether it was or not.</p>

<p>When I left John Steadiman in charge, the ship was still going
at a great rate through the water. The wind still blew right
astern. Though she was making great way, she was under shortened
sail, and had no more than she could easily carry. All was
snug, and nothing complained. There was a pretty sea running,
but not a high sea neither, nor at all a confused one.</p>

<p>I turned in, as we seamen say, all standing. The meaning of
that is, I did not pull my clothes off—no, not even so much as
my coat; though I did my shoes, for my feet were badly swelled
with the deck. There was a little swing-lamp alight in my cabin.
I thought, as I looked at it before shutting my eyes, that I was
so tired of darkness and troubled by darkness, that I could have
gone to sleep best in the midst of a million of flaming gas-lights.
That was the last thought I had before I went off, except
the prevailing thought that I should not be able to get to sleep
at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<h6>THE WRECK</h6>

<p>I dreamed that I was back at Penrith again, and was trying to
get round the church, which had altered its shape very much since
I last saw it, and was cloven all down the middle of the steeple in
a most singular manner. Why I wanted to get round the church
I don’t know; but I was as anxious to do it as if my life depended
on it. Indeed, I believe it did in the dream. For all that, I could
not get round the church. I was still trying, when I came against
it with a violent shock, and was flung out of my cot against the
ship’s side. Shrieks and a terrific outcry struck me far harder
than the bruising timbers, and amidst sounds of grinding and
crashing, and a heavy rushing and breaking of water—sounds I
understood too well—I made my way on deck. It was not an easy
thing to do, for the ship heeled over frightfully, and was beating
in a furious manner.</p>

<p>I could not see the men as I went forward, but I could hear
that they were hauling in sail, in disorder. I had my trumpet in
my hand, and, after directing and encouraging them in this till it
was done, I hailed first John Steadiman, and then my second mate,
Mr. William Rames. Both answered clearly and steadily. Now,
I had practiced them and all my crew, as I have ever made it a
custom to practice all who sail with me, to take certain stations
and wait my orders, in case of any unexpected crisis. When my
voice was heard hailing, and their voices were heard answering,
I was aware, through all the noises of the ship and sea, and all the
crying of the passengers below, that there was a pause. “Are you
ready, Rames?”—“Ay, ay, sir!”—“Then light up, for God’s
sake!” In a moment he and another were burning blue-lights, and
the ship and all on board seemed to be enclosed in a mist of light,
under a great black dome.</p>

<p>The light shone up so high that I could see the huge Iceberg
upon which we had struck, cloven at the top and down the middle,
exactly like Penrith Church in my dream. At the same moment
I could see the watch last relieved crowding up and down on deck;
I could see Mrs. Atherfield and Miss Coleshaw thrown about on
the top of the companion as they struggled to bring the child up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
from below; I could see that the masts were going with the shock
and the beating of the ship; I could see the <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref419">frightful breach</a> stove
in on the starboard side, half the length of the vessel, and the
sheathing and timbers spirting up; I could see that the Cutter was
disabled, in a wreck of broken fragments; and I could see every
eye turned upon me. It is my belief that if there had been ten
thousand eyes there, I should have seen them all, with their different
looks. And all this in a moment. But you must consider
what a moment.</p>

<p>I saw the men, as they looked at me, fall toward their appointed
stations, like good men and true. If she had not righted,
they could have done very little there or anywhere but die—not
that it is little for a man to die at his post—I mean they could
have done nothing to save the passengers and themselves. Happily,
however, the violence of the shock with which we had so
determinedly borne down direct on that fatal Iceberg, as if it
had been our destination instead of our destruction, had so
smashed and pounded the ship that she got off in this same
instant and righted. I did not want the carpenter to tell me she
was filling and going down; I could see and hear that. I gave
Rames the word to lower the Long-boat and the Surf-boat, and
I myself told off the men for each duty. Not one hung back, or
came before the other. I now whispered to John Steadiman,
“John, I stand at the gangway here, to see every soul on board
safe over the side. You shall have the next post of honor, and
shall be the last but one to leave the ship. Bring up the passengers,
and range them behind me; and put what provision and
water you can get at in the boats. Cast your eye forward, John,
and you’ll see you have not a moment to lose.”</p>

<p>My noble fellows got the boats over the side as orderly as I
ever saw boats lowered with any sea running, and when they
were launched, two or three of the nearest men in them as they
held on, rising and falling with the swell, called out, looking up
at me, “Captain Ravender, if anything goes wrong with us, and
you are saved, remember, we stood by you!”—“We’ll all stand
by one another ashore, yet, please God, my lads!” says I. “Hold
on bravely, and be tender with the women.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The women were an example to us. They trembled very
much, but they were quiet and perfectly collected. “Kiss me,
Captain Ravender,” says Mrs. Atherfield, “and God in heaven
bless you, you good man!” “My dear,” says I, “those words are
better for me than a life-boat.” I held her child in my arms till
she was in the boat, and then kissed the child and handed her
safe down. I now said to the people in her, “You have got your
freight, my lads, all but me, and I am not coming yet awhile.
Pull away from the ship, and keep off!”</p>

<p>That was the Long-boat. Old Mr. Rarx was one of her complement,
and he was the only passenger who had greatly misbehaved
since the ship struck. Others had been a little wild,
which was not to be wondered at, and not very blamable; but, he
had made a lamentation and uproar which it was dangerous for
the people to hear, as there is always contagion in weakness and
selfishness. His incessant cry had been that he must not be separated
from the child, that he couldn’t see the child, and that he
and the child must go together. He had even tried to wrest the
child out of my arms, that he might keep her in his. “Mr. Rarx,”
said I to him when it came to that, “I have a loaded pistol in my
pocket; and if you don’t stand out of the gangway, and keep perfectly
quiet, I shall shoot you through the heart, if you have got
one.” Says he, “You won’t do murder, Captain Ravender!” “No,
sir,” says I, “I won’t murder forty-four people to humor you, but
I’ll shoot you to save them.” After that he was quiet, and stood
shivering a little way off, until I named him to go over the side.</p>

<p>The Long-boat being cast off, the Surf-boat was soon filled.
There only remained aboard the Golden Mary, John Mullion,
the man who had kept on burning the blue-lights (and who had
so lighted every new one at every old one before it went out, as
quietly as if he had been at an illumination); John Steadiman;
and myself. I hurried those two into the Surf-boat, called to
them to keep off, and waited with a grateful and relieved heart
for the Long-boat to come and take me in, if she could. I looked
at my watch, and it showed me, by the blue-light, ten minutes
past two. They lost no time. As soon as she was near enough,
I swung myself into her, and called to the men, “With a will,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
lads! She’s reeling!” We were not an inch too far out of the
<a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref420">inner vortex</a> of her going down, when, by the blue-light which
John Mullion still burnt in the bow of the Surf-boat, we saw her
lurch, and plunge to the bottom head-foremost. The child cried,
weeping wildly, “O the dear Golden Mary! O look at her! Save
her! Save the poor Golden Mary!” And then the light burned
out, and the black dome seemed to come down upon us.</p>

<h6>ADRIFT IN LIFE BOATS</h6>

<p>I suppose if we had all stood atop of a mountain, and seen the
whole remainder of the world sink away from under us, we could
hardly have felt more shocked and solitary than we did when we
knew we were alone on the wide ocean, and that the beautiful
ship in which most of us had been securely asleep within half an
hour was gone for ever. There was an awful silence in our boat,
and such a kind of palsy on the rowers and the man at the rudder,
that I felt they were scarcely keeping her before the sea. I spoke
out then, and said, “Let every one here thank the Lord for our
preservation!” All the voices answered (even the child’s), “We
thank the Lord!” I then said the Lord’s Prayer, and all hands
said it after me with a solemn murmuring. Then I gave the word
“Cheerily, O men, cheerily!” and I felt that they were handling
the boat again as a boat ought to be handled.</p>

<p>The Surf-boat now burned another blue-light to show us where
they were, and we made for her, and laid ourselves as nearly
alongside of her as we dared. I had always kept my boats with
a coil or two of good stout stuff in each of them, so both boats
had a rope at hand. We made a shift, with much labor and
trouble, to get near enough to one another to divide the blue-lights
(they were no use after that night, for the sea-water soon got
at them), and to get a <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref421">tow-rope</a> out between us. All night long
we kept together, sometimes obliged to cast off the rope, and
sometimes getting it out again, and all of us wearying for the
morning—which appeared so long in coming that old Mr. Rarx
screamed out, in spite of his fears of me, “The world is drawing
to an end, and the sun will never rise any more!”</p>

<p>When the day broke, I found that we were all huddled together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
in a miserable manner. We were deep in the water; being, as I
found on mustering, thirty-one in number, or at least six too
many. In the Surf-boat they were fourteen in number, being at
least four too many. The first thing I did, was to get myself
passed to the rudder—which I took from that time—and to get
Mrs. Atherfield, her child, and Miss Coleshaw, passed on to sit
next me. As to old Mr. Rarx, I put him in the bow, as far from
us as I could. And I put some of the best men near us in order
that if I should drop there might be a skillful hand ready to take
the helm.</p>

<p>The sea moderating as the sun came up, though the sky was
cloudy and wild, we spoke the other boat, to know what stores
they had, and to overhaul what we had. I had a compass in my
pocket, a small telescope, a double-barreled pistol, a knife, and
a fire-box and matches. Most of my men had knives, and some
had a little tobacco; some, a pipe as well. We had a mug among
us, and an iron spoon. As to provisions, there were in my boat two
bags of biscuit, one piece of raw beef, one piece of raw pork, a bag
of coffee, roasted but not ground (thrown in, I imagine, by mistake,
for something else), two small casks of water, and about half
a gallon of rum in a keg. The Surf-boat, having rather more rum
than we, and fewer to drink it, gave us, as I estimated, another
quart into our keg. In return, we gave them three double handfuls
of coffee, tied up in a piece of a handkerchief; they reported
that they had aboard besides, a bag of biscuit, a piece of beef,
a small cask of water, a small box of lemons, and a Dutch cheese.
It took a long time to make these exchanges, and they were not
made without risk to both parties; the sea running quite high
enough to make our approaching near to one another very hazardous.
In the bundle with the coffee, I conveyed to John Steadiman
(who had a ship’s compass with him), a paper written in pencil,
and torn from my pocket-book, containing the course I meant to
steer, in the hope of making land, or being picked up by some
vessel—I say in the hope, though I had little hope of either deliverance.
I then sang out to him, so as all might hear, that if we
two boats could live or die together, we would; but, that if we
should be parted by the weather, and join company no more, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
should have our prayers and blessings, and we asked for theirs.
We then gave them three cheers, which they returned, and I saw
the men’s heads droop in both boats as they fell to their oars
again.</p>

<p>These arrangements had occupied the general attention advantageously
for all, though (as I expressed in the last sentence)
they ended in a sorrowful feeling. I now said a few words to my
fellow-voyagers on the subject of the small stock of food on which
our lives depended if they were preserved from the great deep,
and on the rigid necessity of our eking it out in the most <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref422">frugal
manner</a>. One and all replied that whatever allowance I thought
best to lay down should be strictly kept to. We made a pair of
scales out of a thin scrap of iron-plating and some twine, and I
got together for weights such of the heaviest buttons among us as
I calculated made up some fraction over two ounces. This was
the allowance of solid food served out once a day to each, from
that time to the end; with the addition of a coffee-berry, or sometimes
half a one, when the weather was very fair, for breakfast.
We had nothing else whatever, but half a pint of water each per
day, and sometimes, when we were coldest and weakest, a teaspoonful
of rum each, served out as a dram. I know how learnedly
it can be shown that rum is poison, but I also know that in this
case, as in all similar cases I have ever read of—which are numerous—no
words can express the comfort and support derived from
it. Nor have I the least doubt that it saved the lives of far more
than half our number. Having mentioned half a pint of water
as our daily allowance, I ought to observe that sometimes we had
less, and sometimes we had more; for much rain fell, and we
caught it in a canvas stretched for the purpose.</p>

<p>Thus, at that tempestuous time of the year, and in that tempestuous
part of the world, we shipwrecked people rose and fell
with the waves. It is not my intention to relate (if I can avoid
it) such <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref423">circumstances appertaining</a> to our doleful condition as
have been better told in many other narratives of the kind than I
can be expected to tell them. I will only note, in so many passing
words, that day after day and night after night, we received the
sea upon our backs to prevent it from swamping the boat; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
one party was always kept bailing, and that every hat and cap
among us soon got worn out, though patched up fifty times, as the
only vessels we had for that service; that another party lay down
in the bottom of the boat, while a third rowed; and that we were
soon all in boils and blisters and rags.</p>

<p>The other boat was a source of such anxious interest to all of
us that I used to wonder whether, if we were saved, the time could
ever come when the survivors in this boat of ours could be at all
indifferent to the fortunes of the survivors in that. We got out a
tow-rope whenever the weather permitted, but that did not often
happen, and how we two parties kept within the same horizon, as
we did, He, who mercifully permitted it to be so for our consolation,
only knows. I never shall forget the looks with which, when
the morning light came, we used to gaze about us over the stormy
waters, for the other boat. We once parted company for seventy-two
hours, and we believed them to have gone down, as they did
us. The joy on both sides when we came within view of one
another again, had something in a manner Divine in it; each was
so forgetful of individual suffering, in tears of delight and sympathy
for the people in the other boat.</p>

<p>I have been wanting to get round to the individual or personal
part of my subject, as I call it, and the foregoing incident puts
me in the right way. The patience and good disposition aboard
of us, was wonderful. I was not surprised by it in the women;
for all men born of women know what great qualities they will
show when men fail; but, I own I was a little surprised by it in
some of the men. Among one-and-thirty people assembled at the
best of times, there will usually, I should say, be two or three
uncertain tempers. I knew that I had more than one rough temper
with me among my own people, for I had chosen those for the
Long-boat that I might have them under my eye. But, they softened
under their misery, and were as considerate of the ladies, and
as compassionate of the child, as the best among us, or among men—they
could not have been more so. I heard scarcely any complaining.
The party lying down would moan a good deal in their
sleep, and I would often notice a man—not always the same man,
it is to be understood, but clearly all of them at one time or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
other—sitting moaning at his oar, or in his place, as he looked mistily
over the sea. When it happened to be long before I could catch
his eye, he would go on moaning all the time in the dismalest manner;
but when our looks met, he would brighten and leave off.
I almost always got the impression that he did not know what
sound he had been making, but that he thought he had been
humming a tune.</p>

<p>Our sufferings from cold and wet were far greater than our
sufferings from hunger. We managed to keep the child warm;
but, I doubt if any one else among us ever was warm for five
minutes together; and the shivering, and the chattering of teeth,
were sad to hear. The child cried a little at first for her lost playfellow,
the Golden Mary; but hardly ever whimpered afterwards;
and when the state of the weather made it possible, she used now
and then to be held up in the arms of some of us, to look over the
sea for John Steadiman’s boat. I see the golden hair and the
innocent face now, between me and the driving clouds, like an
angel going to fly away.</p>

<p>It happened on the second day, toward night, that Mrs. Atherfield,
in getting little Lucy to sleep, sang her a song. She had a
soft, melodious voice, and when she had finished it, our people up
and begged for another. She sang them another, and after it had
fallen dark ended with the Evening Hymn. From that time,
whenever anything could be heard above the sea and wind, and
while she had any voice left, nothing would serve the people but
that she should sing at sunset. She always did, and always ended
with the Evening Hymn. We mostly took up the last line, and
shed tears when it was done, but not miserably. We had a prayer
night and morning, also, when the weather allowed of it.</p>

<p>Twelve nights and eleven days we had been driving in the
boat, when old Mr. Rarx began to be delirious, and to cry out to
me to throw the gold overboard or it would sink us, and we should
all be lost. For days past the child had been declining, and that
was the great cause of his wildness. He had been over and
over again shrieking out to me to give her all the remaining meat,
to give her all the remaining rum, to save her at any cost, or we
should all be ruined. At this time, she lay in her mother’s arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
at my feet. One of her little hands was almost always creeping
about her mother’s neck or chin. I had watched the wasting of
the little hand, and I knew it was nearly over.</p>

<p>The old man’s cries were so discordant with the mother’s love,
and submission, that I called out to him in an angry voice, unless
he held his peace on the instant, I would order him to be knocked
on the head and thrown overboard. He was mute then, until the
child died, very peacefully, an hour afterwards; which was known
to all in the boat by the mother’s breaking out into lamentations
for the first time since the wreck—for she had <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref424">great fortitude</a> and
constancy, though she was a little gentle woman. Old Mr. Rarx
then became quite ungovernable, tearing what rags he had on
him, <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref425">raging in imprecations</a>, and calling to me that if I had
thrown the gold overboard (always the gold with him!) I might
have saved the child. “And now,” says he, in a terrible voice,
“we shall founder, and all go to the Devil, for our sins will sink
us, when we have no innocent child to bear us up!” We soon discovered
with amazement, that this old wretch had only cared
for the life of the pretty little creature dear to all of us, because
of the influence he superstitiously hoped she might have in preserving
him! Altogether it was too much for the smith, or
armorer, who was sitting next the old man, to bear. He took
him by the throat and rolled him under the thwarts, where he
lay still enough for hours afterwards.</p>

<p>All that thirteenth night, Miss Coleshaw, lying across my
knees as I kept the helm, comforted and supported the poor
mother. Her child, covered with a pea-jacket of mine, lay in her
lap. It troubled me all night to think that there was no Prayer-Book
among us, and that I could remember but very few of the
exact words of the burial service. When I stood up at broad day,
all knew what was going to be done, and I noticed that my poor
fellows made the motion of uncovering their heads, though their
heads had been stark bare to the sky and sea for many a weary
hour. There was a long heavy swell on, but otherwise it was a
fair morning, and there were broad fields of sunlight on the waves
in the east. I said no more than this: “I am the Resurrection
and the Life, saith the Lord. He raised the daughter of Jairus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the ruler, and said she was not dead but slept. He raised the
widow’s son. He arose Himself, and was seen of many. He
loved little children, saying, ‘Suffer them to come unto Me and
rebuke them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.’ In His
name, my friends, and committed to His merciful goodness!”
With those words I laid my rough face softly on the placid little
forehead, and buried the Golden Lucy in the grave of the Golden
Mary.</p>

<p>Having had it on my mind to relate the end of this dear little
child, I have omitted something from its exact place, which I will
supply here. It will come quite as well here as anywhere else.</p>

<p>Foreseeing that if the boat lived through the stormy weather,
the time must come, and soon come, when we should have absolutely
no morsel to eat, I had one momentous point often in my
thoughts. Although I had, years before that, fully satisfied
myself that the instances in which human beings in the last distress
have fed upon each other, are exceedingly few, and have
very seldom indeed (if ever) occurred when the people in distress,
however dreadful their extremity, have been accustomed to moderate
forbearance and restraint; I say, though I had long before
quite satisfied my mind on this topic, I felt doubtful whether
there might not have been in former cases some harm and danger
from keeping it out of sight and pretending not to think of it. I
felt doubtful whether some minds, growing weak with fasting and
exposure and having such a terrific idea to dwell upon in secret,
might not magnify it until it got to have an awful attraction
about it. This was not a new thought of mine, for it had grown
out of my reading. However, it came over me stronger than it
had ever done before—as it had reason for doing—in the boat,
and on the fourth day I decided that I would bring out into the
light that unformed fear which must have been more or less
darkly in every brain among us. Therefore, as a means of beguiling
the time and inspiring hope, I gave them the best summary
in my power of Bligh’s voyage of more than three thousand
miles, in an open boat, after the Mutiny of the Bounty, and of
the wonderful preservation of that boat’s crew. They listened
throughout with great interest, and I concluded by telling them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
that, in my opinion, the happiest circumstance in the whole narrative
was that Bligh, who was no delicate man, either, had
solemnly placed it on record therein that he was sure and certain
that under no conceivable circumstances whatever would that
emaciated party, who had gone through all the pains of famine,
have preyed on one another. I cannot describe the visible relief
which this spread through the boat, and how the tears stood in
every eye. From that time I was as well convinced as Bligh
himself that there was no danger, and that this phantom, at any
rate, did not haunt us.</p>

<p>Now, it was a part of Bligh’s experience that when the people
in his boat were most cast down, nothing did them so much good
as hearing a story told by one of their number. When I mentioned
that, I saw that it struck the general attention as much
as it did my own, for I had not thought of it until I came to it
in my summary. This was on the day after Mrs. Atherfield first
sang to us. I proposed that, whenever the weather would permit,
we should have a story two hours after dinner (I always issued
the allowance I have mentioned at one o’clock, and called it by
that name), as well as our song at sunset. The proposal was
received with a cheerful satisfaction that warmed my heart within
me; and I do not say too much when I say that those two periods
in the four-and-twenty hours were expected with positive pleasure,
and were really enjoyed by all hands. Specters as we soon
were, in our bodily wasting, our imaginations did not perish like
the gross flesh upon our bones. Music and Adventure, two of
the great gifts of Providence to mankind, could charm us long
after that was lost.</p>

<p>The wind was almost always against us after the second day;
and for many days together we could not nearly hold our own.
We had all varieties of bad weather. We had rain, hail, snow,
wind, mist, thunder, and lightning. Still the boats lived through
the heavy seas, and still we perishing people rose and fell with
the great waves.</p>

<p>Sixteen nights and fifteen days, twenty nights and nineteen
days, twenty-four nights and twenty-three days. So the time
went on. Disheartening as I knew that our progress, or want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of progress, must be, I never deceived them as to my calculations
of it. In the first place, I felt that we were all too near eternity
for deceit; in the second place, I knew that if I failed, or died,
the man who followed me must have a knowledge of the true state
of things to begin upon. When I told them at noon, what I
reckoned we had made or lost, they generally received what I
said in a tranquil and resigned manner, and always gratefully
toward me. It was not unusual at any time of the day for some
one to burst out weeping loudly without any new cause; and,
when the burst was over, to calm down a little better than before.
I had seen exactly the same thing in a house of mourning.</p>

<p>During the whole of this time, old Mr. Rarx had had his fits
of calling out to me to throw the gold (always the gold!) overboard,
and of heaping violent reproaches upon me for not having
saved the child; but now, the food being all gone, and I having
nothing left to serve out but a bit of coffee-berry now and then,
he began to be too weak to do this, and consequently fell silent.
Mrs. Atherfield and Miss Coleshaw generally lay, each with an
arm across one of my knees and her head upon it. They never
complained at all. Up to the time of her child’s death, Mrs.
Atherfield had bound up her own beautiful hair every day; and I
took particular notice that this was always before she sang her
song at night, when every one looked at her. But she never did
it after the loss of her darling; and it would have been now all
tangled with dirt and wet, but that Miss Coleshaw was careful
of it long after she was, herself, and would sometimes smooth it
down with her weak thin hands.</p>

<p>We were <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref426">past mustering</a> a story now; but one day, at about
this period, I reverted to the superstition of old Mr. Rarx, concerning
the Golden Lucy, and told them that nothing vanished
from the eye of God, though much might pass away from the
eyes of men. “We were all of us,” says I, “children once; and
our baby feet have strolled in green woods ashore; and our baby
hands have gathered flowers in gardens, where the birds were
singing. The children that we were, are not lost to the great
knowledge of our Creator. Those innocent creatures will appear
with us before Him, and plead for us. What we were in the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
time of our generous youth will arise and go with us too. The
purest part of our lives will not desert us at the pass to which all
of us here present are gliding. What we were then, will be as
much in existence before Him, as what we are now.” They were
no less comforted by this consideration, than I was myself; and
Miss Coleshaw, drawing my ear nearer to her lips, said, “Captain
Ravender, I was on my way to marry a disgraced and broken
man, whom I dearly loved when he was honorable and good.
Your words seem to have come out of my own poor heart.” She
pressed my hand upon it, smiling.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven nights and twenty-six days. We were in no want
of rain-water, but we had nothing else. And yet, even now, I
never turned my eyes on a waking face but it tried to brighten
before mine. O what a thing it is, in a time of danger and in
the presence of death, the shining of a face upon a face! I have
heard it broached that orders should be given in great new ships
by electric telegraph. I admire machinery as much as any man,
and am as thankful to it as any man can be for what it does for
us. But it will never be a substitute for the face of a man, with
his soul in it, encouraging another man to be brave and true.
Never try it for that. It will break down like a straw.</p>

<p>I now began to remark certain changes in myself which I did
not like. They caused me much disquiet. I often saw the
Golden Lucy in the air above the boat. I often saw her I have
spoken of before, sitting beside me. I saw the Golden Mary go
down, as she really had gone down, twenty times in a day. And
yet the sea was mostly, to my thinking, not sea neither, but
moving country and extraordinary mountainous regions, the like
of which have never been beheld. I felt it time to leave my last
words regarding John Steadiman, in case any lips should last out
to repeat them to any living ears. I said that John had told me
(as he had on deck) that he had sung out “Breakers ahead!” the
instant they were audible, and had tried <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref427">to wear ship</a>, but she
struck before it could be done. (His cry, I dare say, had made
my dream.) I said that the circumstances were altogether without
warning, and out of any course that could have been guarded
against; that the same loss would have happened if I had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
in charge; and that John was not to blame, but from first to last
had done his duty nobly, like the man he was. I tried to write
it down in my pocket-book, but could make no words, though I
knew what the words were that I wanted to make. When it had
come to that, her hands—though she was dead so long—laid me
down gently in the bottom of the boat, and she and the Golden
Lucy swung me to sleep.</p>

<h6>THE TALE OF THE CHIEF MATE</h6>

<p><i>All that follows was written by John Steadiman, Chief Mate:</i></p>

<p>On the twenty-sixth day after the foundering of the Golden
Mary at sea, I, John Steadiman, was sitting in my place in the
stern-sheets of the Surf-boat, with just sense enough left in me
to steer—that is to say, with my eyes strained, wide-awake, over
the bows of the boat, and my brains fast asleep and dreaming—when
I was roused upon a sudden by our second mate, Mr.
William Rames.</p>

<p>“Let me take a spell in your place,” says he. “And look you
out for the Long-boat astern. The last time she rose on the crest
of a wave, I thought I made out a signal flying aboard her.”</p>

<p>We shifted our places, clumsily and slowly enough, for we
were both of us weak and dazed with wet, cold, and hunger. I
waited some time, watching the heavy rollers astern, before the
Long-boat rose atop of one of them at the same time with us. At
last, she was heaved up for a moment well in view, and there,
sure enough, was the signal flying aboard of her—a strip of rag
of some sort, rigged to an oar, and hoisted in her bows.</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” says Rames to me in a quavering,
trembling sort of voice. “Do they signal a sail in sight?”</p>

<p>“Hush, for God’s sake!” says I, clapping my hand over his
mouth. “Don’t let the people hear you. They’ll all go mad
together if we mislead them about that signal. Wait a bit, till I
have another look at it.”</p>

<p>I held on by him, for he had set me all of a tremble with his
notion of a sail in sight, and watched for the Long-boat again.
Up she rose on the top of another roller. I made out the signal
clearly, that second time, and saw that it was rigged half-mast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rames,” says I, “it’s a signal of distress. Pass the word
forward to keep her before the sea, and no more. We must get
the Long-boat within hailing distance of us, as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>I dropped down into my old place at the tiller without another
word—for the thought went through me like a knife that something
had happened to Captain Ravender. I should consider
myself unworthy to write another line of this statement, if I had
not made up my mind to speak the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth—and I must, therefore, confess plainly that
now, for the first time, my heart sank within me. This weakness
on my part was produced in some degree, as I take it, by the
<a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref428">exhausting effects</a> of previous anxiety and grief.</p>

<p>Our provisions—if I may give that name to what we had left—were
reduced to the rind of one lemon and about a couple of
handfuls of coffee-berries. Besides these great distresses, caused
by the death, the danger, and the suffering among my crew and
passengers, I had had a little distress of my own to shake me still
more, in the death of the child whom I had got to be very fond
of on the voyage out—so fond that I was secretly a little jealous
of her being taken in the Long-boat instead of mine when the
ship foundered. It used to be a great comfort to me, and I think
to those with me also, after we had seen the last of the Golden
Mary, to see the Golden Lucy, held up by the men in the Long-boat,
when the weather allowed it, as the best and brightest sight
they had to show. She looked, at the distance we saw her from,
almost like a little white bird in the air. To miss her for the
first time, when the weather lulled a little again, and we all looked
out for our white bird and looked in vain, was a sore disappointment.
To see the men’s heads bowed down and the captain’s
hand pointing into the sea when we hailed the Long-boat, a few
days after, gave me as heavy a shock and as sharp a pang of
heartache to bear as ever I remember suffering in all my life. I
only mention these things to show that if I did give way a little
at first, under the dread that our captain was lost to us, it was
not without having been a good deal shaken beforehand by more
trials of one sort or another than often fall to one man’s share.</p>

<p>I had got over the choking in my throat with the help of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
drop of water, and had steadied my mind again so as to be prepared
against the worst, when I heard the hail (Lord help the poor
fellows, how weak it sounded!)—</p>

<p>“Surf-boat, ahoy!”</p>

<p>I looked up, and there were our companions in misfortune
<a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref429">tossing abreast</a> of us; not so near that we could make out the
features of any of them, but near enough, with some exertion for
people in our condition, to make their voices heard in the intervals
when the wind was weakest.</p>

<p>I answered the hail, and waited a bit, and heard nothing, and
then sang out the captain’s name. The voice that replied did not
sound like his; the words that reached us were:</p>

<p>“Chief mate wanted on board!”</p>

<p>Every man of my crew knew what that meant as well as I
did. As second officer in command, there could be but one reason
for wanting me on board the Long-boat. A groan went all round
us, and my men looked darkly in each other’s faces, and whispered
under their breaths:</p>

<p>“The captain is dead!”</p>

<p>I commanded them to be silent, and not to make too sure of
bad news, at such a pass as things had now come to with us.
Then, hailing the Long-boat, I signified that I was ready to go
on board when the weather would let me—stopped a bit to draw
a good long breath—and then called out as loud as I could the
dreadful question:</p>

<p>“Is the captain dead?”</p>

<p>The black figures of three or four men in the after-part of the
Long-boat all stooped down together as my voice reached them.
They were lost to view for about a minute; then appeared again—one
man among them was held up on his feet by the rest, and
he hailed back the blessed words (a very faint hope went a very
long way with people in our desperate situation): “Not yet!”</p>

<p>The relief felt by me, and by all with me, when we knew that
our captain, though unfitted for duty, was not lost to us, it is not
in words—at least, not in such words as a man like me can command—to
express. I did my best to cheer the men by telling
them what a good sign it was that we were not as badly off yet as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
we had feared, and then communicated what instructions I had
to give, to William Rames, who was to be left in command in my
place when I took charge of the Long-boat. After that, there was
nothing to be done, but to wait for the chance of the wind dropping
at sunset, and the sea going down afterwards, so as to enable
our weak crews to lay the two boats alongside of each other,
without undue risk—or, to put it plainer, without saddling ourselves
with the necessity for any extraordinary exertion of
strength or skill. Both the one and the other had now been
starved out of us for days and days together.</p>

<p>At sunset the wind suddenly dropped, but the sea, which had
been running high for so long a time past, took hours after that
before it showed any signs of getting to rest. The moon was
shining, the sky was wonderfully clear, and it could not have
been, according to my calculations, far off midnight, when the
long, slow, regular swell of the calming ocean fairly set in, and
I took the responsibility of lessening the distance between the
Long-boat and ourselves.</p>

<p>It was, I dare say, a delusion of mine; but I thought I had
never seen the moon shine so white and ghastly anywhere, either
at sea or on land, as she shone that night while we were approaching
our companions in misery. When there was not much more
than a boat’s length between us, and the white light streamed
cold and clear over all our faces, both crews rested on their oars
with one great shudder, and stared over the gunwale of either
boat, panic-stricken at the first sight of each other.</p>

<p>“Any lives lost among you?” I asked, in the midst of that
frightful silence.</p>

<p>The men in the Long-boat huddled together like sheep at the
sound of my voice.</p>

<p>“None yet, but the child, thanks be to God!” answered one
among them.</p>

<p>And at the sound of his voice, all my men shrank together
like the men in the Long-boat. I was afraid to let the horror
produced by our first meeting at close quarters after the dreadful
changes that wet, cold, and famine had produced, last one moment
longer than could be helped; so, without giving time for any more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
questions and answers, I commanded the men to lay the two boats
close alongside of each other. When I rose up and committed
the tiller to the hands of Rames, all my poor fellows raised their
white faces imploringly to mine. “Don’t leave us, sir,” they said,
“don’t leave us.” “I leave you,” says I, “under the command
and the guidance of Mr. William Rames, as good a sailor as I am,
and as trusty and kind a man as ever stepped. Do your duty by
him, as you have done it by me; and remember to the last, that
while there is life there is hope. God bless and help you all!”</p>

<p>With those words I collected what strength I had left, and caught
at two arms that were held out to me, and so got from the stern-sheets
of one boat into the stern-sheets of the other.</p>

<p>“Mind where you step, sir,” whispered one of the men who had
helped me into the Long-boat. I looked down as he spoke. Three
figures were huddled up below me, with the moonshine falling on
them in ragged streaks through the gaps between the men standing
or sitting above them. The first face I made out was the
face of Miss Coleshaw; her eyes were wide open and fixed on me.
She seemed still to keep her senses, and, by the alternate parting
and closing of her lips, to be trying to speak, but I could not
hear that she uttered a single word. On her shoulder rested the
head of Mrs. Atherfield. The mother of our poor little Golden
Lucy must, I think, have been dreaming of the child she had lost;
for there was a faint smile just ruffling the white stillness of her
face, when I first saw it turned upward, with peaceful closed eyes
toward the heavens. From her, I looked down a little, and there,
with his head on her lap, and with one of her hands resting tenderly
on his cheek—there lay the captain, to whose help and
guidance, up to this miserable time, we had never looked in vain,—there,
worn out at last in our service, and for our sakes, lay the
best and bravest man of all our company. I stole my hand in
gently through his clothes and laid it on his heart, and felt a little
feeble warmth over it, though my cold dulled touch could not
detect even the faintest beating. The two men in the stern-sheets
with me, noticing what I was doing—knowing I loved him like a
brother—and seeing, I suppose, more distress in my face than I
myself was conscious of its showing, lost command over themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
altogether, and burst into a piteous moaning, <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref430">sobbing lamentation</a>
over him. One of the two drew aside a jacket from his feet,
and showed me that they were bare, except where a wet, ragged
strip of stocking still clung to one of them. When the ship struck
the Iceberg, he had run on deck leaving his shoes in his cabin.
All through the voyage in the boat his feet had been unprotected;
and not a soul had discovered it until he dropped! As long as
he could keep his eyes open, the very look of them had cheered
the men, and comforted and upheld the women. Not one living
creature in the boat, with any sense about him, but had felt the
good influence of that brave man in one way or another. Not one
but had heard him, over and over again, give the credit to others
which was due only to himself; praising this man for patience,
and thanking that man for help, when the patience and the help
had really and truly, as to the best part or both, come only from
him. All this, and much more, I heard pouring confusedly from
the men’s lips while they crouched down, sobbing and crying over
their commander, and wrapping the jacket as warmly and tenderly
as they could over his cold feet. It went to my heart to
check them; but I knew that if this lamenting spirit spread any
further, all chance of keeping alight any last sparks of hope and
resolution among the boat’s company would be lost for ever.
Accordingly I sent them to their places, spoke a few encouraging
words to the men forward, promising to serve out, when the
morning came, as much as I dared, of any eatable thing left in
the lockers; called to Rames, in my old boat, to keep as near us
as he safely could; drew the garments and coverings of the two
poor suffering women more closely about them; and, with a secret
prayer to be directed for the best in bearing the awful responsibility
now laid on my shoulders, took my captain’s vacant place
at the helm of the Long-boat.</p>

<p>This, as well as I can tell it, is the full and true account of
how I came to be placed in charge of the lost passengers and
crew of the Golden Mary, on the morning of the twenty-seventh
day after the ship struck the Iceberg, and foundered at sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Chapter II—The Rescue</span></h5>

<h6>THE END OF THE FOOD SUPPLY</h6>

<p>When the sun rose on the twenty-seventh day of our calamity,
the first question that I secretly asked myself was, “How many
more mornings will the stoutest of us live to see”? I had kept
count, ever since we took to the boats, of the days of the week;
and I knew that we had now arrived at another Thursday. Judging
by my own sensations (and I believe I had as much strength
left as the best man among us), I came to the conclusion that,
unless the mercy of Providence interposed to effect our deliverance,
not one of our company could hope to see another morning
after the morning of Sunday.</p>

<p>Two discoveries that I made—after redeeming my promise
overnight, to serve out with the morning whatever eatable thing
I could find—helped to confirm me in my gloomy view of our
future prospects. In the first place, when the few coffee-berries
left, together with a small allowance of water, had been shared
all round, I found on examining the lockers that not one grain of
provision remained, fore or aft, in any part of the boat, and that
our stock of fresh water was reduced to not much more than
would fill a wine-bottle. In the second place, after the berries
had been shared, and the water equally divided, I noticed that
the sustenance thus administered produced no effect whatever,
even of the most momentary kind, in raising the spirits of the
passengers (excepting in one case) or in rallying the strength of
the crew. The exception was Mr. Rarx. This tough and greedy
old sinner seemed to wake up from the trance he had lain in so
long, when the smell of the berries and water was under his nose.
He swallowed his share with a gulp that many a younger and
better man in the boat might have envied; and <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref431">went maundering</a>
on to himself afterwards, as if he had got a new lease of life. He
fancied now that he was digging a gold-mine, all by himself, and
going down bodily straight through the earth at the rate of thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
or forty miles an hour. “Leave me alone,” says he, “leave me
alone. The lower I go, the richer I get. Down I go!—down,
down, down, down, till I burst out at the other end of the world
in a shower of gold!” So he went on, kicking feebly with his
heels from time to time against the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>But, as for all the rest, it was a pitiful and dreadful sight to
see of how little use their last shadow of a meal was to them. I
myself attended, before anybody else was served, to the two poor
women. Miss Coleshaw shook her head faintly, and pointed to
her throat, when I offered her the few berries that fell to her
share. I made a shift to crush them up fine and mix them with
a little water, and got her to swallow that miserable drop of drink
with the greatest difficulty. When it was down there came no
change for the better over her face. Nor did she recover, for so
much as a moment, the capacity to speak, even in a whisper. I
next tried Mrs. Atherfield. It was hard to wake her out of the
half-swooning, half-sleeping condition in which she lay—and
harder still to get her to open her lips when I put the tin-cup to
them. When I had at last prevailed on her to swallow her allowance,
she shut her eyes again, and fell back into her old position.
I saw her lips moving; and, putting my ear close to them, caught
some of the words she was murmuring to herself. She was still
dreaming of the Golden Lucy. She and the child were walking
somewhere by the banks of a lake, at the time the buttercups are
out. The Golden Lucy was gathering the buttercups, and making
herself a watch-chain out of them, in imitation of the chain that
her mother wore. They were carrying a little basket with them,
and were going to dine together in a great hollow tree growing
on the banks of the lake. To get this pretty picture painted on
one’s mind as I got it, while listening to the poor mother’s broken
words, and then to look up at the haggard faces of the men in the
boat, and at the wild ocean rolling all round us, was such a change
from fancy to reality as it has fallen, I hope, to few men’s lots to
experience.</p>

<p>My next thought, when I had done my best for the women,
was for the captain. I was free to risk losing my own share of
water, if I pleased, so I tried, before tasting it myself, to get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
little between his lips; but his teeth were fast clenched, and I had
neither strength nor skill to open them. The faint warmth still
remained, thank God, over his heart—but, in all other respects he
lay beneath us like a dead man. In covering him up again as
comfortably as I could, I found a bit of paper crunched in one of
his hands, and took it out. There was some writing on it, but not
a word was readable. I suppose, poor fellow, that he had been
trying to write some last instructions for me, just before he
dropped at his post. If they had been ever so easy to read, they
would have been of no use now. To follow instructions we must
have had some power to shape the boat’s course in a given direction—and
this, which we had been gradually losing for some days
past, we had now lost altogether.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the serving out of the refreshment would
have put a little modicum of strength into the arms of the men
at the oars; but, as I have hinted, this hope turned out to be perfectly
fruitless. Our last mockery of a meal, which had done
nothing for the passengers, did nothing either for the crew—except
to aggravate the pangs of hunger in the men who were still
strong enough to feel them. While the weather held moderate, it
was not of much consequence if one or two of the rowers kept
dropping, in turn, into a kind of faint sleep over their oars. But
if it came on to blow again (and we could expect nothing else in
those seas and at that time of the year), how was I to steer, when
the blades of the oars were out of the water ten times as often
as they were in? The lives which we had undergone such suffering
to preserve would have been lost in an instant by the
swamping of the boat, if the wind had risen on the morning of
Thursday, and had caught us trying to row any longer.</p>

<p>Feeling this, I resolved, while the weather held moderately
fine, to hoist the best substitute for a sail that we could produce,
and to drive before the wind, on the chance (the last we had hope
for) of a ship picking us up. We had only continued to use the
oars up to this time in order to keep the course which the captain
had pointed out as likeliest to bring us near the land. Sailing
had been out of the question from the first, the masts and suits
of sails belonging to each boat having been out of them at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
time of the wreck, and having gone down with the ship. This
was an accident which there was no need to deplore, for we were
too crowded from the first to admit of handling the boats properly,
under their regular press of sail, in anything like rough
weather.</p>

<p>Having made up my mind on what it was necessary to do I
addressed the men, and told them that any notion of holding
longer on our course with the oars was manifestly out of the
question, and dangerous to all on board, as their own common
sense might tell them, in the state to which the stoutest arms
among us were now reduced. They looked round on each other
as I said that, each man seeming to think his neighbor weaker
than himself. I went on, and told them that we must take advantage
of our present glimpse of moderate weather, and hoist
the best sail we could set up, and drive before the wind, in the
hope that it might please God to direct us in the way of some
ship before it was too late. “Our only chance, my men,” I said,
in conclusion, “is the chance of being picked up; and in these
<a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref432">desolate seas</a> one point of the compass is just as likely a point for
our necessities as another. Half of you keep the boat before the
sea, the other half bring out your knives, and do as I tell you.”
The prospect of being relieved from the oars struck the wandering
attention of the men directly; and they said, “Ay, ay, sir!”
with something like a faint reflection of their former readiness,
when the good ship was under their feet, and the mess-cans were
filled with plenty of wholesome food.</p>

<p>Thanks to Captain Ravender’s forethought in providing both
boats with a coil of rope, we had our lashings, and the means of
making what rigging was wanted, ready to hand. One of the
oars was made fast to the thwart, and well stayed fore and aft,
for a mast. A large pilot-coat that I wore was spread; enough of
sail for us. The only difficulty that puzzled me was occasioned
by the necessity of making a yard. The men tried to tear up one
of the thwarts, but were not strong enough. My own knife had
been broken in the attempt to split a bit of plank for them; and
I was almost at my wit’s end, when I luckily thought of searching
the captain’s pockets for his knife. I found it—a fine large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
knife of Sheffield manufacture, with plenty of blades, and a small
saw among them. With this we made a shift to saw off about
a third of another oar; and then the difficulty was conquered; and
we got my pilot-coat hoisted on our jury-mast, and rigged it as
nigh as we could to the fashion of a lug-sail.</p>

<p>I had looked anxiously toward the Surf-boat, while we were
rigging our mast, and observed, with a feeling of great relief,
that the men in her—as soon as they discovered what we were
about—were wise enough to follow our example. They got on
faster than we did; being less put to it for room to turn round in.
We set our sails as nearly as possible about the same time; and
it was well for both boats that we finished our work when we did.
At noon the wind began to rise again to a stiff breeze, which soon
knocked up a heavy, tumbling sea. We drove before it in a
direction North by East, keeping wonderfully dry, considering
all things. The mast stood well; and the sail, small as it was,
did good service in steadying the boat and lifting her easily over
the seas. I felt the cold after the loss of my coat, but not so
badly as I had feared; for the two men who were with me in the
stern-sheets, sat as close as they could on either side of me, and
helped with the warmth of their own bodies to keep the warmth
in mine. Forward, I told off half a dozen of the most trustworthy
of the men who could still muster strength enough to
keep their eyes open, to set a watch, turn and turn about, on our
frail rigging. The wind was steadily increasing; and if any accident
happened to our mast the chances were that the boat would
broach-to, and that every one of us would go to the bottom.</p>

<p>So we drove on—all through that day—sometimes catching
sight of the Surf-boat a little ahead of us—sometimes losing her
altogether in the scud. How little and frail, how very different
to the kind of boat that I had expected to see, she looked to my
eyes now that I was out of her, and saw what she showed like
on the waters for the first time! But to return to the Long-boat.
The watch on the rigging was relieved every two hours, and at
the same regular periods all the brightest eyes left amongst us
looked out for the smallest vestige of a sail in view, and looked
in vain. Among the passengers, nothing happened in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
of a change—except that Miss Coleshaw seemed to grow fainter,
and that Mrs. Atherfield got restless, as if she were waking out
of her long dream about the Golden Lucy.</p>

<p>It got on toward sunset. The wind was rising to half a gale.
The clouds, which had been heavy all over the firmament since
noon, were lifting to the westward, and leaving there, over the
horizon line of the ocean, a long strip of clear, pale, greenish sky,
overhung by a cloud-bank, whose ragged edges were tipped with
burning crimson by the sun. I did not like the look of the night,
and, keeping where I was, in the forward part of the boat, I
helped the men to ease the strain off our mast, by lowering the
yard a little and taking a pull on the sheet, so as to present to
the wind a smaller surface even of our small sail. Noting the
wild look of the weather, and the precautions we were taking
against the chance of a gale rising in the night—and being, furthermore,
as I believe, staggered in their minds by the death
that had taken place among them—three of the passengers struggled
up in the bottom of the boat, clasped their arms around me
as if they were drowning men already, and hoarsely clamored for
a last drink of water, before the storm rose and sent us all to the
bottom.</p>

<p>“Water you shall have,” I said, “when I think the time has
come to serve it out. The time has not come yet.”</p>

<p>“Water, pray!” they all three groaned together. Two more
passengers who were asleep, woke up, and joined the cry.</p>

<p>“Silence!” I said. “There are not two spoonfuls of fresh
water left for each man in the boat. I shall wait three hours more
for the chance of rain before I serve that out. Silence, and drop
back to your places!”</p>

<h6>A SAIL IN SIGHT</h6>

<p>They let go of me, but clamored weakly for water still; and,
this time, the voices of some of the crew joined them. At this
moment, to my great alarm (for I thought they were going mad
and turning violent against me), I was seized round the neck by
one of the men, who had been standing up, holding on by the
mast, and looking out steadily to the westward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>I raised my right hand to free myself; but before I touched
him, the sight of the man’s face close to mine made me drop my
arm again. There was a speechless, breathless, frantic joy in it,
that made all the blood in my veins stand still in a moment.</p>

<p>“Out with it!” I said. “Man alive, out with it, for God’s
sake!”</p>

<p>His breath beat on my cheek in hot, quick, heavy gasps; but
he could not utter a word. For a moment he let go of the mast
(tightening his hold on me with the other arm) and pointed
out westward—then slid heavily down on to the thwart behind
us.</p>

<p>I looked westward, and saw that one of the two trustworthy
men whom I had left at the helm was on his feet looking out westward,
too. As the boat rose, I fixed my eyes on the strip of clear
greenish sky in the west, and on the bright line of the sea just
under it. The boat dipped again before I could see anything. I
squeezed my eyelids together to get the water out of them, and
when we rose again looked straight into the middle of the bright
sea-line. My heart bounded as if it would choke me—my tongue
felt like a cinder in my mouth—my knees gave way under me—I
dropped down on to the thwart, and sobbed out, with a great
effort, as if I had been dumb for weeks before, and had only that
instant found my speech:</p>

<p>“A sail! a sail!”</p>

<p>The words were <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref433">instantly echoed</a> by the man in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>“Sail, ho!” he screeches out, turning round on me and swinging
his arms about his head like a madman.</p>

<p>This made three of our company who had seen the ship
already, and that one fact was sufficient to remove all dread lest
our eyes might have been deceiving us. The great fear now was,
not that we were deluded, but that we might come to some serious
harm through the excess of joy among the people; that is to say,
among such of the people as still had the sense to feel and the
strength to express what they felt. I must record in my own
justification, after confessing that I lost command over myself
altogether on the discovery of the sail, that I was the first who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
set the example of self-control. I was in a manner forced to this
by the crew frantically <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref434">entreating me to lay-to</a> until we could
make out what course the ship was steering—a proceeding which,
with the sea then running, with the heavy lading of the boat,
and with such feeble substitutes for mast and sail as we possessed,
must have been attended with total destruction to us all. I tried
to remind the men of this, but they were in such a transport—hugging
each other round the neck, and crying and laughing all
in a breath—that they were not fit to listen to reason. Accordingly,
I myself went to the helm again, and chose the steadiest
of my two men in the after-part of the boat, as a guard over the
sheet, with instructions to use force, if necessary, toward any one
who stretched out so much as a finger to it. The wind was rising
every minute, and we had nothing for it but to scud, and be
thankful to God’s mercy that we had sea-room to do it in.</p>

<p>“It will be dark in an hour’s time, sir,” says the man left along
with me when I took the helm again. “We have no light to show.
The ship will pass us in the night. Lay-to, sir! For the love of
Heaven, give us all a chance, and lay-to!” says he, and goes down
on his knees before me, wringing his hands.</p>

<p>“Lay-to!” says I. “Lay-to, under a coat! Lay-to, in a boat
like this, with the wind getting up a gale! A seaman like you
talk in that way! Who have I got along here with me? Sailors
who know their craft, or a pack of ’longshore lubbers, who ought
to be turned adrift in a ferry-boat on a pond?” My heart was
heavy enough, God knows, but I spoke out as loud as I could, in
that light way, to try and shame the men back to their proper
senses. I succeeded at least in restoring silence; and that was
something in such a condition as ours.</p>

<p>My next anxiety was to know if the men in the Surf-boat had
sighted the sail to the westward. She was still driving ahead of
us, and the first time I saw her rise on the waves, I made out a
signal on board—a strip of cloth fastened to a boat-hook. I
ordered the man by my side to return it with his jacket tied on
to the end of the oar; being anxious to see whether his agitation
had calmed down and left him fit for his duty again. He followed
my direction steadily and when he got his jacket on again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
asked me to pardon him for losing his self-command, in a quiet,
altered voice.</p>

<p>I shook hands with him, and gave him the helm, in proof that
my confidence was restored; then stood up and turned my face
to the westward once again. I looked long into the belt of clear
sky, which was narrowing already as the cloud-bank above sank
over it. I looked with all my heart and soul and strength. It
was only when my eyes could stand the strain on them no longer,
that I gave in, and sat down again by the tiller. If I had not
been supported by a firm trust in the mercy of Providence, which
had preserved us thus far, I am afraid I should have abandoned
myself at that trying time to downright hopeless, speechless
despair.</p>

<p>It would not express much to any but seafaring readers if I
mentioned the number of leagues off that I considered the ship to
be. I shall give a better idea of the terrible distance there was
between us, when I say that no landsman’s eye could have made
her out at all, and that none of us sailors could have seen her but
for the bright opening in the sky, which made even a speck on the
waters visible to a mariner’s experienced sight all that weary
way off. When I have said this, I have said enough to render it
plain to every man’s understanding that it was a sheer impossibility
to make out what course the ship was steering, seeing that
we had no chance of keeping her in view at that closing time of
day for more than another half-hour, at most. There she was,
astern to leeward of us; and here were we, driving for our lives
before the wind, with any means of kindling a light that we might
have possessed on leaving our ship, wetted through long ago—with
no guns to fire as signals of distress in the darkness—and
with no choice, if the wind shifted, but still to scud in any direction
in which it might please to drive us. Supposing, even at the
best, that the ship was steering on our course, and would overhaul
us in the night, what chance had we of making our position known
to her in the darkness? Truly, look at it anyhow we might from
our poor mortal point of view, our prospect of deliverance seemed
to be of the most utterly hopeless kind that it is possible to
conceive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The men felt this bitterly, as the cloud-bank dropped to the
verge of the waters, and the sun set redly behind it. The moaning
and lamenting among them was miserable to hear, when the
last speck and phantom of the ship had vanished from view.
Some few still swore they saw her when there was hardly a flicker
of light left in the west, and only gave up looking out, and
dropped down in the boat, at my express orders. I charged them
all solemnly to set an example of courage to the passengers, and
to trust the rest to the infinite wisdom and mercy of the Creator
of us all. Some murmured, some fell to repeating scraps out of
the Bible and Prayer-Book, some wandered again in their minds.
This went on till the darkness gathered—then a great hush of
silence fell drearily over passengers and crew; and the waves and
the wind hissed and howled about us, as if we were tossing in the
midst of them, a boat-load of corpses already!</p>

<p>Twice in the fore-part of the night the clouds overhead parted
for a little, and let the blessed moonlight down upon us. On the
first of those occasions, I myself served out the last drops of fresh
water we had left. The two women—poor suffering creatures!—were
past drinking. Miss Coleshaw shivered a little when I
moistened her lips with the water; and Mrs. Atherfield, when I
did the same for her, drew her breath with a faint, fluttering sigh,
which was just enough to show that she was not dead yet. The
captain still lay as he had lain ever since I got on board the boat.
The others, both passengers and crew, managed for the most part
to swallow their share of the water—the men being just sufficiently
roused by it to get up on their knees, while the moonlight
lasted, and look about wildly over the ocean for a chance of seeing
the ship again. When the clouds gathered once more, they
crouched back in their places with a long groan of despair. Hearing
that, and dreading the effect of the pitchy darkness (to say
nothing of the fierce wind and sea) on their sinking spirits, I
resolved to <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref435">combat their despondency</a>, if it were still possible to
contend against it, by giving them something to do. First telling
them that no man could say at what time of the night the ship
(in case she was steering our course) might forge ahead of us, or
how near she might be when she passed, I recommended that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
who had the strength should join their voices at regular intervals,
and shout their loudest when the boat rose highest on the waves,
on the chance of that cry of distress being borne by the wind
within hearing of the watch on board the ship. It is unnecessary
to say that I knew well how near it was to an absolute impossibility
that this last feeble exertion on our parts could lead to any
result. I only proposed it because I was driven to the end of my
resources to keep up the faintest flicker of spirit among the men.
They received my proposal with more warmth and readiness than
I had ventured, in their hopeless state, to expect from them. Up
to the turn of midnight they resolutely raised their voices with
me, at intervals of from five to ten minutes, whenever the boat
was tossed highest on the waves. The wind seemed to whirl our
weak cries savagely out of our mouths almost before we could
utter them. I, sitting astern in the boat, only heard them, as it
seemed, for something like an instant of time. But even that was
enough to make me creep all over—the cry was so forlorn and
fearful. Of all the dreadful sounds I had heard since the first
striking of the ship, that shrill wail of despair—rising on the
wavetops, one moment; whirled away the next, into the black
night—was the most frightful that entered my ears. There are
times, even now, when it seems to be ringing in them still.</p>

<p>Whether our first gleam of moonshine fell upon old Mr. Rarx,
while he was sleeping, and helped to upset his weak brains altogether,
is more than I can say. But, for some reason or other,
before the clouds parted and let the light down on us for the
second time, and while we were driving along awfully through the
blackest of the night, he stirred in his place, and began rambling
and raving again more vehemently than ever. To hear him now—that
is to say, as well as I could hear him for the wind—he was
still down in his gold-mine; but was laden so heavy with his
precious metal that he could not get out, and was in mortal peril
of being drowned by the water rising in the bottom of the shaft.
So far, his maundering attracted my attention disagreeably, and
did no more. But when he began—if I may say so—to take the
name of the dear little dead child in vain, and to mix her up with
himself and his miserly greed of gain, I got angry and called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the men forward to give him a shake and make him hold his
tongue. Whether any of them obeyed or not, I don’t know—Mr.
Rarx went on raving louder than ever. The shrill wind was now
hardly more shrill than he. He swore he saw the white frock of
our poor little lost pet fluttering in the daylight, at the top of the
mine, and he screamed out to her in a great fright that the gold
was heavy, and the water rising fast, and that she must come
down as quick as lightning if she meant to be in time to help
them. I called again angrily to the men to silence him; and
just as I did so, the clouds began to part for the second time, and
the white tip of the moon grew visible.</p>

<p>“There she is!” screeches Mr. Rarx; and I saw him by the
faint light, scramble on his knees in the bottom of the boat, and
wave a ragged old handkerchief up at the moon.</p>

<p>“Pull him down!” I called out. “Down with him; and tie his
arms and legs!”</p>

<p>Of the men who could still move about, not one paid any
attention to me. They were all upon their knees again, looking
out in the strengthening moonlight for a sight of the ship.</p>

<p>“Quick, Golden Lucy!” screams Mr. Rarx, and creeps under
the thwarts right forward into the bows of the boat. “Quick!
my darling, my beauty, quick! The gold is heavy, and the water
rises fast! Come down and save me, Golden Lucy! Let all the
rest of the world drown, and save me! Me! me! me! me!”</p>

<p>He shouted these last words out at the top of his cracked,
croaking voice, and got on his feet, as I conjectured (for the coat
we had spread for a sail now hid him from me) in the bows of the
boat. Not one of the crew so much as looked round at him, so
eagerly were their eyes seeking for the ship. The man sitting
by me was sunk in a deep sleep. If I had left the helm for a
moment in that wind and sea, it would have been the death of
every soul of us. I shouted desperately to the raving wretch to
sit down. A screech that seemed to cut the very wind in two
answered me. A huge wave tossed the boat’s head up wildly at
the same moment. I looked aside to leeward as the wash of
the great roller swept by us, gleaming of a lurid, bluish white in
the moonbeams; I looked and saw, in one second of time, the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of Mr. Rarx rush past on the wave, with the foam seething in his
hair and the moon shining in his eyes. Before I could draw my
breath he was a hundred yards astern of us, and the night and
the sea had swallowed him up and had hid his secret, which he
had kept all the voyage, from our mortal curiosity, for ever.</p>

<p>“He’s gone! he’s drowned!” I shouted to the men forward.</p>

<p>None of them took any notice; none of them left off looking
out over the ocean for a sight of the ship. Nothing that I could
say on the subject of our situation at that fearful time can, in my
opinion, give such an idea of the extremity and the frightfulness
of it, as the relation of this one fact. I leave it to speak by itself
the sad and shocking truth, and pass on gladly to the telling of
what happened next, at a later hour of the night.</p>

<p>After the clouds had shut out the moon again, the wind
dropped a little and shifted a point or two, so as to shape our
course nearer to the eastward. How the hours passed after that,
till the dawn came, is more than I can tell. The nearer the time
of daylight approached the more completely everything seemed
to drop out of my mind, except the one thought of where the ship
we had seen in the evening might be, when we looked for her with
the morning light.</p>

<p>It came at last—that gray, quiet light which was to end all
our uncertainty; which was to show us if we were saved, or to
warn us if we were to prepare for death. With the first streak in
the east, every one of the boat’s company, excepting the sleeping
and the senseless, roused up and looked out in breathless silence
upon the sea. Slowly and slowly the daylight strengthened, and
the darkness rolled off farther and farther before it over the face
of the waters. The first pale flush of the sun flew trembling along
the paths of light broken through the gray wastes of the eastern
clouds. We could look clearly—we could see far; and there, ahead
of us—O! merciful, bountiful providence of God!—there was the
ship!</p>

<p>I have honestly owned the truth, and confessed to the human
infirmity under suffering of myself, my passengers, and my crew.
I have earned, therefore, as I would fain hope, the right to record
it to the credit of all, that the men, the moment they set eyes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the ship, poured out their whole heart in humble thanksgiving to
the Divine Mercy which had saved them from the very jaws of
death. They did not wait for me to bid them do this; they did it
of their own accord, in their own language, fervently, earnestly,
with one will and one heart.</p>

<h6>SAFETY AT LAST</h6>

<p>We had hardly made the ship out—a fine brigantine, hoisting
English colors—before we observed that her crew suddenly hove
her up in the wind. At first we were at a loss to understand this;
but as we drew nearer, we discovered that she was getting the
Surf-boat (which had kept ahead of us all through the night)
alongside of her, under the lee bow. My men tried to cheer when
they saw their companions in safety, but their weak cries died
away in tears and sobbing.</p>

<p>In another half-hour we, too, were alongside of the brigantine.</p>

<p>From this point I recollect nothing very distinctly. I remember
faintly many loud voices and eager faces—I remember fresh,
strong, willing fellows, with a color in their cheeks, and a smartness
in their movements that seemed quite preternatural to me
at that time, hanging over us in the rigging of the brigantine, and
dropping down from her sides into our boat—I remember trying
with my feeble hands to help them in the difficult and <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref436">perilous
task</a> of getting the two poor women and the captain on board—I
remember one dark hairy giant of a man swearing that it was
enough to break his heart, and catching me in his arms like a
child—and from that moment I remember nothing more with the
slightest certainty for over a week of time.</p>

<p>When I came to my own senses again, in my cot on board
the brigantine, my first inquiries were naturally for my fellow-sufferers.
Two—a passenger in the Long-boat, and one of the
crew of the Surf-boat—had sunk in spite of all the care that could
be taken of them. The rest were likely, with time and attention,
to recover. Of those who have been particularly mentioned in this
narrative, Mrs. Atherfield had shown signs of rallying the soonest;
Miss Coleshaw, who had held out longer against exhaustion,
was now the slower to recover. Captain Ravender, though slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
mending, was still not able to speak or to move in his cot without
help. The sacrifices for us all which this good man had so nobly
undergone, not only in the boat, but before that, when he had
deprived himself of his natural rest on the dark nights that preceded
the wreck of the Golden Mary, had sadly undermined his
natural strength of constitution. He, the heartiest of all, when
we sailed from England, was now, through his unwearying devotion
to his duty and to us, the last to recover, the longest to linger
between life and death.</p>

<p>My next questions (when they helped me on deck to get my
first blessed breath of fresh air) related to the vessel that had
saved us. She was bound to the Columbia River—a long way
to the northward of the port for which we had sailed in the Golden
Mary. Most providentially for us, shortly after we had lost sight
of the brigantine in the shades of the evening, she had been caught
in a squall, and had <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref437">sprung her foretopmast</a> badly. This accident
had obliged them to lay-to for some hours, while they did
their best to secure the spar, and had warned them, when they
continued on their course, to keep the ship under easy sail through
the night. But for this circumstance we must, in all human probability,
have been too far astern when the morning dawned, to
have had the slightest chance of being discovered.</p>

<p>Excepting always some of the stoutest of our men, the next
of the Long-boat’s company who was helped on deck was Mrs.
Atherfield. Poor soul! when she and I first looked at each other,
I could see that her heart went back to the early days of our
voyage, when the Golden Lucy and I used to have our game of
hide-and-seek round the mast. She squeezed my hand as hard as
she could with her wasted trembling fingers, and looked up piteously
in my face, as if she would like to speak to little Lucy’s
playfellow, but dared not trust herself—then turned away quickly
and laid her head against the bulwarks, and looked out upon the
desolate sea that was nothing to her now but her darling’s grave.
I was better pleased when I saw her later in the day, sitting by
Captain Ravender’s cot; for she seemed to take comfort in nursing
him. Miss Coleshaw soon afterwards got strong enough to relieve
her at this duty; and, between them, they did the captain such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
world of good, both in body and spirit, that he also got strong
enough before long to come on deck, and to thank me, in his old,
generous, self-forgetful way, for having done my duty—the duty
which I had learned how to do by his example.</p>

<p>Hearing what our destination had been when we sailed from
England, the captain of the brigantine (who had treated us with
the most <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref438">unremitting attention</a> and kindness, and had been
warmly seconded in his efforts for our good by all the people under
his command) volunteered to go sufficiently out of his course to
enable us to speak the first Californian coasting-vessel sailing in
the direction of San Francisco. We were lucky in meeting with
one of these sooner than we expected. Three days after parting
from the kind captain of the brigantine, we, the surviving passengers
and crew of the Golden Mary, touched the firm ground once
more, on the shores of California.</p>

<p>We were hardly collected here before we were obliged to separate
again. Captain Ravender, though he was hardly yet in
good <a href="#phrases40" title="List of phrases" id="ref439">traveling trim</a>, accompanied Mrs. Atherfield inland, to see
her safe under her husband’s protection. Miss Coleshaw went
with them, to stay with Mrs. Atherfield for a little while before
she attempted to proceed with any matters of her own which had
brought her to this part of the world. The rest of us, who were
left behind with nothing particular to do until the captain’s
return, followed the passengers to the gold-diggings. Some few
of us had enough of the life there in a very short time. The rest
seemed bitten by old Mr. Rarx’s mania for gold, and insisted on
stopping behind when Rames and I proposed going back to the
port. We two, and five of our steadiest seamen, were all the
officers and crew left to meet the captain on his return from the
inland country.</p>

<p>He reported that he had left Mrs. Atherfield and Miss Coleshaw
safe and comfortable under Mr. Atherfield’s care. They
sent affectionate messages to all of us, and especially (I am proud
to say) to me. After hearing this good news, there seemed
nothing better to do than to ship on board the first vessel bound
for England. There were plenty in port, ready to sail and only
waiting for the men belonging to them who had deserted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
gold-diggings. We were all snapped up eagerly, and offered any
rate we chose to set on our services, the moment we made known
our readiness to ship for England—all, I ought to have said,
except Captain Ravender, who went along with us in the capacity
of passenger only.</p>

<p>Nothing of any moment occurred on the voyage back. The
captain and I got ashore at Gravesend safe and hearty, and
went up to London as fast as the train could carry us, to report
the calamity that had occurred to the owners of the Golden Mary.
When that duty had been performed, Captain Ravender went
back to his own house at Poplar, and I traveled to the West of
England to report myself to my old father and mother.</p>

<p>Here I might well end all these pages of writing; but I cannot
refrain from adding a few more sentences, to tell the reader what
I am sure he will be glad to hear. In the summer-time of this
present year eighteen hundred and fifty-six, I happened to be at
New York, and having spare time on my hands, and spare cash
in my pocket, I walked into one of the biggest and grandest of
their ordinaries there, to have my dinner. I had hardly sat down
at table, before whom should I see opposite but Mrs. Atherfield, as
bright-eyed and pretty as ever, with a gentleman on her right
hand, and on her left—another Golden Lucy! Her hair was a
shade or two darker than the hair of my poor little pet of past
sad times; but in all other respects the living child reminded me
so strongly of the dead, that I quite started at the first sight of
her. I could not tell if I was to try, how happy we were after
dinner, or how much we had to say to each other. I was introduced
to Mrs. Atherfield’s husband, and heard from him, among
other things, that Miss Coleshaw was married to her old sweetheart,
who had fallen into misfortunes and errors, and whom she
was determined to set right by giving him the great chance in
life of getting a good wife. They were settled in America, like
Mr. and Mrs. Atherfield—these last and the child being on their
way, when I met them, to visit a friend living in the northernmost
part of the States.</p>

<p>With the relation of this circumstance, and with my personal
testimony to the good health and spirits of Captain Ravender the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
last time I saw him, ends all that I have to say in connection with
the subject of the Wreck of the Golden Mary, and the Great Deliverance
of her People at Sea.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was a great English novelist.
When a mere boy he moved to London, where he afterward lived and wrote.
As a child he was neglected and his education was limited. He first showed
his ability to write when he became a reporter for a London newspaper.
Here his unusual powers of narration and description brought him marked
success in writing character sketches, which he signed “Boz.” Before
Dickens was thirty he was the most popular writer in England. He
attacked the cruelty and stupidity with which the children of the poor were
treated in English schools; he opened the eyes of the people to the injustice
that was suffered by laborers and all poor people; he saw also, like Robert
Burns, the sincerity and simple happiness that often make the poor more to
be envied than the rich. No other novelist has invented so many characters
that seem flesh and blood; they appeal to us because they are “folks,” not
imaginary dwellers in an unreal world. You will note this ability and the
author’s rare power of telling a story, as you read “The Wreck of the Golden
Mary.” Dickens made two visits to America, where he was received with
great enthusiasm. His second visit was made in 1867, when he gave public
readings from his own works. His vivid imagination and keen human sympathy
give to his writings a peculiar interest and charm.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Has Dickens any purpose in writing this story, except
to interest and entertain? 2. Are you more interested in the characters, or
in the things that happen to them; that is, is this tale a character study or
a story of adventure? 3. Is it both? 4. Does the story contain much conversation,
or is it mainly narration? 5. Are there many descriptions
in it? 6. Are they descriptions of nature, of people, or of events? 7. Read
what you consider the finest description. 8. What two persons tell the
story? 9. Which makes the more decided impression upon you? 10. How
does Captain Ravender describe himself? 11. Are his words in keeping
with his education and occupation—such as a self-educated, seafaring
man would be likely to use? 12. Select and read expressions which indicate
that he is a sailor and uses a sailor’s speech. 13. Name some of the
Captain’s characteristics and read passages to illustrate each. 14. Notice
that his character is revealed to us, (1) through his own words in relating
the story; (2) through what he does; (3) through the conduct of others
toward him; and (4) through the chief mate’s words. Read lines to illustrate
each. 15. Which of the other characters is most interesting? 16. Select
incidents which show the influence upon others of the Captain’s cheerfulness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
resourcefulness, bravery, common-sense, and determination. 17. Do
you think one of the purposes Dickens had in writing this story may have
been to picture the influence of a brave, just, and generous spirit in such
adverse circumstances? 18. Pronounce the following: extraordinary; calculations;
sustenance.</p>

<h4>AS YOU LIKE IT</h4>

<p class="author">CHARLES AND MARY LAMB</p>

<p>During the time that France was divided into provinces (or
dukedoms as they were called) there reigned in one of these provinces
an <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref440">usurper, who had deposed</a> and banished his elder brother,
the lawful duke.</p>

<p>The duke, who was thus driven from his dominions, retired
with a few faithful followers to the forest of Arden; and here the
good duke lived with his loving friends, who had put themselves
into a <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref441">voluntary exile</a> for his sake, while their land and revenues
enriched the false usurper; and custom soon made the life of careless
ease they led here more sweet to them than the pomp and
<a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref442">uneasy splendor</a> of a courtier’s life. Here they lived like the old
Robin Hood of England, and to this forest many noble youths
daily resorted from the court, and did fleet the time carelessly, as
they did who lived in the golden age. In the summer they lay
along under the fine shade of the large forest trees, marking the
playful sports of the wild deer; and so fond were they of these
poor <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref443">dappled fools</a>, who seemed to be the native inhabitants of
the forest, that it grieved them to be forced to kill them to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
themselves with venison for their food. When the cold winds of
winter made the duke feel the change of his <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref444">adverse fortune</a>, he
would endure it patiently, and say, “These chilling winds which
blow upon my body are true counselors; they do not flatter, but
represent truly to me my condition; and though they bite sharply,
their tooth is nothing like so keen as that of unkindness and ingratitude.
I find that howsoever men speak against adversity,
yet some sweet uses are to be extracted from it; like the jewel,
precious for medicine, which is taken from the head of the venomous
and despised toad.” In this manner did the patient duke
draw a useful moral from everything that he saw; and by the help
of this moralizing turn, in that life of his, remote from public
haunts, he could find tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
sermons in stones, and good in everything.</p>

<p>The banished duke had an only daughter, named Rosalind;
whom the usurper, Duke Frederick, when he banished her father,
still retained in his court as a companion for his own daughter
Celia. A strict friendship subsisted between these ladies, which
the disagreement between their fathers did not in the least interrupt,
Celia striving by every kindness in her power to make
amends to Rosalind for the injustice of her own father in deposing
the father of Rosalind; and whenever the thoughts of her father’s
banishment, and her own dependence on the false usurper, made
Rosalind melancholy, Celia’s whole care was to comfort and
console her.</p>

<p>One day, when Celia was talking in her usual kind manner to
Rosalind, saying, “I pray you, Rosalind, my sweet cousin, be
merry,” a messenger entered from the duke, to tell them that if
they wished to see a wrestling match, which was just going to
begin, they must come instantly to the court before the palace;
and Celia, thinking it would amuse Rosalind, agreed to go and
see it.</p>

<p>In those times wrestling, which is only practiced now by
country clowns, was a favorite sport even in the courts of princes,
and before fair ladies and princesses. To this wrestling match,
therefore, Celia and Rosalind went. They found that it was
likely to prove a very tragical sight; for a large and powerful man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
who had been long practiced in the art of wrestling, and had slain
many men in contests of this kind, was just going to wrestle with
a very young man, who, from his extreme youth and inexperience
in the art, the beholders all thought would certainly be killed.</p>

<p>When the duke saw Celia and Rosalind, he said, “How now,
daughter and niece, are you crept hither to see the wrestling?
You will take little delight in it, there is such odds in the men; in
pity to this young man, I would wish to persuade him from
wrestling. Speak to him, ladies, and see if you can not move
him.”</p>

<p>The ladies were well pleased to perform this <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref445">humane office</a>,
and first Celia entreated the young stranger that he would desist
from the attempt; and then Rosalind spoke so kindly to him, and
with such feeling consideration for the danger he was about to
undergo, that instead of being persuaded by her gentle words <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref446">to
forego his purpose</a>, all his thoughts were bent to distinguish himself
by his courage in this lovely lady’s eyes. He refused the
request of Celia and Rosalind in such graceful and modest words,
that they felt still more concern for him; he concluded his refusal
with saying, “I am sorry to deny such fair and excellent ladies
anything. But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me
to my trial, wherein if I be conquered there is one shamed that
was never gracious; if I am killed, there is one dead that is willing
to die; I shall do my friends no wrong, for I have none to lament
me; the world no injury, for in it I have nothing; for I only fill
up a place in the world which may be better supplied when I have
made it empty.”</p>

<p>And now the wrestling match began. Celia wished the young
stranger might not be hurt; but Rosalind felt most for him. The
friendless state which he said he was in, and that he wished to
die, made Rosalind think that he was like herself, unfortunate;
and she pitied him so much, and so deep an interest she took in
his danger while he was wrestling, that she might almost be said
at that moment to have fallen in love with him.</p>

<p>The kindness shown this unknown youth by these fair and
noble ladies gave him courage and strength, so that he performed
wonders; and in the end completely conquered his antagonist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
who was so much hurt, that for a while he was unable to speak
or move.</p>

<p>The Duke Frederick was much pleased with the courage and
skill shown by this young stranger; and desired to know his name
and parentage, meaning to take him under his protection.</p>

<p>The stranger said his name was Orlando, and that he was the
youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.</p>

<p>Sir Rowland de Boys, the father of Orlando, had been dead
some years; but when he was living, he had been a true subject
and dear friend of the banished duke; therefore, when Frederick
heard Orlando was the son of his banished brother’s friend, all his
liking for this brave young man was changed into displeasure,
and he left the place in very ill humor. Hating to hear the very
name of any of his brother’s friends, and yet still admiring the
valor of the youth, he said, as he went out, that he wished Orlando
had been the son of any other man.</p>

<p>Rosalind was delighted to hear that her new favorite was the
son of her father’s old friend; and she said to Celia, “My father
loved Sir Rowland de Boys, and if I had known this young man
was his son, I would have added tears to my entreaties before he
should have ventured.”</p>

<p>The ladies then went up to him; and seeing him abashed by
the sudden displeasure shown by the duke, they spoke kind and
encouraging words to him; and Rosalind, when they were going
away, turned back to speak some more civil things to the brave
young son of her father’s old friend; and taking a chain from off
her neck, she said, “Gentleman, wear this for me. I am out of
suits with fortune, or I would give you a more valuable present.”</p>

<p>When the ladies were alone, Rosalind’s talk being still of
Orlando, Celia began to perceive her cousin had fallen in love
with the handsome young wrestler, and she said to Rosalind, “Is
it possible you should fall in love so suddenly?” Rosalind replied,
“The duke, my father, loved his father dearly.” “But,” said
Celia, “does it therefore follow that you should love his son
dearly? for then I ought to hate him, for my father hated his
father; yet I do not hate Orlando.”</p>

<p>Frederick being enraged at the sight of Sir Rowland de Boys’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
son, which reminded him of the many friends the banished duke
had among the nobility, and having been for some time displeased
with his niece, because the people praised her for her virtues and
pitied her for her good father’s sake, his <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref447">malice suddenly broke</a> out
against her; and while Celia and Rosalind were talking of Orlando,
Frederick entered the room, and with looks full of anger ordered
Rosalind instantly to leave the palace, and follow her father into
banishment; telling Celia, who in vain pleaded for her, that he had
only suffered Rosalind to stay upon her account. “I did not then,”
said Celia, “entreat you to let her stay, for I was too young at that
time to value her; but now that I know her worth, and that we so
long have slept together, risen at the same instant, learned, played,
and eaten together, I cannot live out of her company.” Frederick
replied, “She is too subtle for you; her smoothness, her very
silence, and her patience speak to the people, and they pity her.
You are a fool to plead for her, for you will seem more bright and
virtuous when she is gone; therefore open not your lips in her
favor, for the doom which I have passed upon her is irrevocable.”</p>

<p>When Celia found she could not prevail upon her father to let
Rosalind remain with her, she generously resolved to accompany
her; and leaving her father’s palace that night, she went along
with her friend to seek Rosalind’s father, the banished duke, in the
forest of Arden.</p>

<p>Before they set out, Celia considered that it would be unsafe
for two young ladies to travel in the rich clothes they then wore;
she therefore proposed that they should disguise their rank by
dressing themselves like country maids. Rosalind said it would
be a still greater protection if one of them was to be dressed like a
man; and so it was quickly agreed on between them, that as Rosalind
was the taller, she should wear the dress of a young countryman,
and Celia should be habited like a country lass, and that
they should say they were brother and sister, and Rosalind said
she would be called Ganymede, and Celia chose the name of
Aliena.</p>

<p>In this disguise, and taking their money and jewels to <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref448">defray
their expenses</a>, these fair princesses set out on their long travel;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
for the forest of Arden was a long way off, beyond the boundaries
of the duke’s dominions.</p>

<p>The lady Rosalind (or Ganymede as she must now be called)
with her manly garb seemed to have put on a manly courage.
The faithful friendship Celia had shown in accompanying Rosalind
so many weary miles, made the new brother, in <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref449">recompense
for this</a> true love, exert a cheerful spirit, as if he were indeed
Ganymede, the rustic and stout-hearted brother of the gentle
village maiden, Aliena.</p>

<p>When at last they came to the forest of Arden, they no longer
found the convenient inns and good accommodations they had met
with on the road; and being in want of food and rest, Ganymede,
who had so merrily cheered his sister with pleasant speeches and
happy remarks all the way, now owned to Aliena that he was so
weary, he could find in his heart to disgrace his man’s apparel,
and cry like a woman; and Aliena declared she could go no farther;
and then again Ganymede tried to recollect that it was a
man’s duty to comfort and console a woman, as the weaker vessel;
and to seem courageous to his new sister, he said, “Come, have
a good heart, my sister Aliena; we are now at the end of our
travel, in the forest of Arden.” But feigned manliness and forced
courage would no longer support them; for though they were in
the forest of Arden, they knew not where to find the duke; and
here the travel of these weary ladies might have come to a sad
conclusion, for they might have lost themselves and perished for
want of food; but providentially, as they were sitting on the grass,
almost dying with fatigue and hopeless of any relief, a countryman
chanced to pass that way, and Ganymede once more tried to
speak with a manly boldness, saying, “Shepherd, if love or gold
can in this desert place procure us entertainment, I pray you
bring us where we may rest ourselves; for this young maid, my
sister, is much fatigued with traveling, and faints for want of
food.”</p>

<p>The man replied that he was only a servant to a shepherd, and
that his master’s house was just going to be sold, and therefore
they would find but poor entertainment; but that if they would
go with him, they should be welcome to what there was. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
followed the man, the near prospect of relief giving them fresh
strength; and bought the house and sheep of the shepherd, and
took the man who conducted them to the shepherd’s house to wait
on them; and being by this means so fortunately provided with a
neat cottage, and well supplied with provisions, they agreed to
stay here till they could learn in what part of the forest the duke
dwelt.</p>

<p>When they were rested after the fatigue of their journey, they
began to like their new way of life, and almost fancied themselves
the shepherd and shepherdess they feigned to be; yet sometimes
Ganymede remembered he had once been the same lady
Rosalind who had so dearly loved the brave Orlando, because he
was the son of old Sir Rowland, her father’s friend; and though
Ganymede thought that Orlando was many miles distant, even
so many weary miles as they had traveled, yet it soon appeared
that Orlando was also in the forest of Arden; and in this manner
this strange event came to pass.</p>

<p>Orlando was the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys, who,
when he died, left him (Orlando being then very young) to the
care of his eldest brother Oliver, charging Oliver on his blessing
to give his brother a good education, and provide for him as became
the dignity of their ancient house. Oliver proved an
unworthy brother; and disregarding the commands of his dying
father, he never put his brother to school, but kept him at home
untaught and entirely neglected. But in his nature and in the
noble qualities of his mind Orlando so much resembled his excellent
father, that without any advantages of education he seemed
like a youth who had been bred with the utmost care; and Oliver
so envied the fine person and dignified manners of his untutored
brother, that at last he wished to destroy him; and to effect this
he set on people to persuade him to wrestle with the famous
wrestler, who, as has been before related, had killed so many
men. Now, it was this cruel brother’s neglect of him which
made Orlando say he wished to die, being so friendless.</p>

<p>When, contrary to the wicked hopes he had formed, his brother
proved victorious, his envy and <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref450">malice knew no bounds</a>, and he
swore he would burn the chamber where Orlando slept. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
overheard making this vow by one that had been an old and faithful
servant to their father, and that loved Orlando because he
resembled Sir Rowland. This old man went out to meet him when
he returned from the duke’s palace, and when he saw Orlando, the
peril his dear young master was in made him break out into these
passionate exclamations: “O my gentle master, my sweet master,
O you memory of old Sir Rowland! why are you virtuous? why
are you gentle, strong, and valiant? and why would you be so
fond to overcome the famous wrestler? Your praise is come too
swiftly home before you.” Orlando, wondering what all this
meant, asked him what was the matter. And then the old man
told him how his wicked brother, envying the love all people
bore him, and now hearing the fame he had gained by his victory
in the duke’s palace, intended to destroy him, by setting fire to
his chamber that night; and in conclusion, advised him to escape
the danger he was in by instant flight; and knowing Orlando had
no money, Adam (for that was the good old man’s name) had
brought out with him his own little hoard, and he said, “I have
five hundred crowns, the thrifty hire I saved under your father,
and laid by to be provision for me when my old limbs should
become unfit for service; take that, and he that doth the ravens
feed be comfort to my age! Here is the gold; all this I give to
you; let me be your servant; though I look old I will do the service
of a younger man in all your business and necessities.” “O
good old man!” said Orlando, “how well appears in you the constant
service of the old world! You are not for the fashion of
these times. We will go along together, and before your youthful
wages are spent, I shall light upon some means for both our
maintenance.”</p>

<p>Together then this faithful servant and his loved master set
out; and Orlando and Adam traveled on, uncertain what course
to pursue, till they came to the forest of Arden, and there they
found themselves in the same distress for want of food that Ganymede
and Aliena had been. They wandered on, seeking some
human habitation, till they were almost spent with hunger and
fatigue. Adam at last said, “O my dear master, I die for want
of food; I can go no farther!” He then laid himself down, thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to make that place his grave, and bade his dear master farewell.
Orlando, seeing him in this weak state, took his old servant
up in his arms and carried him under the shelter of some pleasant
trees; and he said to him, “Cheerly, old Adam, rest your weary
limbs here awhile and do not talk of dying!”</p>

<p>Orlando then searched about to find some food, and he happened
to arrive at that part of the forest where the duke was;
and he and his friends were just going to eat their dinner, this
royal duke being seated on the grass, under no other canopy than
the <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref451">shady covert</a> of some large trees.</p>

<p>Orlando, whom hunger had made desperate, drew his sword,
intending to take their meat by force, and said, “Forbear and
eat no more; I must have your food!” The duke asked him if
distress had made him so bold, or if he were a rude despiser of
good manners. On this Orlando said he was dying with hunger;
and then the duke told him he was welcome to sit down and eat
with them. Orlando hearing him speak so gently, put up his
sword, and blushed with shame at the rude manner in which he
had demanded their food. “Pardon me, I pray you,” said he;
“I thought that all things had been savage here, and therefore I
put on the countenance of stern command; but whatever men you
are, that in this desert, under the shade of melancholy boughs, lose
and neglect the creeping hours of time; if ever you have looked
on better days; if ever you have been where bells have knolled
to church; if you have ever sat at any good man’s feast; if ever
from your eyelids you have wiped a tear, and know what it is to
pity or be pitied, may gentle speeches now move you to do me
human courtesy!” The duke replied, “True it is that we are men
(as you say) who have seen better days, and though we have now
our habitation in this wild forest, we have lived in towns and
cities, and have with holy bell been knolled to church, have sat
at good men’s feasts, and from our eyes have wiped the drops
which <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref452">sacred pity</a> has engendered; therefore sit you down, and
take of our refreshments as much as will minister to your wants.”
“There is an old poor man,” answered Orlando, “who has limped
after me many a weary step in pure love, oppressed at once with
two sad infirmities, age and hunger; till he be satisfied, I must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
touch a bit.” “Go, find him out, and bring him hither,” said the
duke; “we will forbear to eat till you return.” Then Orlando went
like a doe to find its fawn and give it food; and presently returned,
bringing Adam in his arms; and the duke said, “Set down your
<a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref453">venerable burthen</a>; you are both welcome”; and they fed the old
man and cheered his heart, and he revived, and recovered his
health and strength again.</p>

<p>The duke inquired who Orlando was; and when he found that
he was the son of his old friend, Sir Rowland de Boys, he took him
under his protection, and Orlando and his old servant lived with
the duke in the forest.</p>

<p>Orlando arrived in the forest not many days after Ganymede
and Aliena came there, and (as has been before related) bought
the shepherd’s cottage.</p>

<p>Ganymede and Aliena were strangely surprised to find the
name of Rosalind carved on the trees, and love-sonnets, fastened
to them, all addressed to Rosalind; and while they were wondering
how this could be, they met Orlando, and they perceived the
chain which Rosalind had given him about his neck.</p>

<p>Orlando little thought that Ganymede was the fair princess
Rosalind, who, by her noble condescension and favor, had so
won his heart that he passed his whole time in carving her name
upon the trees, and writing sonnets in praise of her beauty; but
being much pleased with the graceful air of this pretty shepherd-youth,
he entered into conversation with him, and he thought he
saw a likeness in Ganymede to his beloved Rosalind, but that he
had none of the dignified deportment of that noble lady; for
Ganymede assumed the forward manners often seen in youths
when they are between boys and men, and with much archness
and humor talked to Orlando of a certain lover, “who,” said he,
“haunts our forest, and spoils our young trees with carving, ‘Rosalind,’
upon their barks; and he hangs odes upon hawthorns and
elegies on brambles, all praising this same Rosalind. If I could
find this lover, I would give him some good counsel that would
soon cure him of his love.”</p>

<p>Orlando confessed that he was the fond lover of whom he
spoke, and asked Ganymede to give him the good counsel he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
talked of. The remedy Ganymede proposed, and the counsel he
gave him, was that Orlando should come every day to the cottage
where he and his sister Aliena dwelt. “And then,” said
Ganymede, “I will feign myself to be Rosalind, and you shall
feign to court me in the same manner as you would do if I was
Rosalind, and then I will imitate the <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref454">fantastic ways</a> of whimsical
ladies to their lovers, till I make you ashamed of your love;
and this is the way I propose to cure you.” Orlando had no
great faith in the remedy, yet he agreed to come every day to
Ganymede’s cottage, and feign a playful courtship; and every
day Orlando visited Ganymede and Aliena, and Orlando called
the shepherd Ganymede his Rosalind, and every day talked over
all the fine words and flattering compliments which young men
delight to use when they court their mistresses. It does not appear,
however, that Ganymede made any progress in curing
Orlando of his love for Rosalind.</p>

<p>Though Orlando thought all this was but a sportive play (not
dreaming that Ganymede was his very Rosalind), yet the opportunity
it gave him of saying all the fond things he had in his heart,
pleased his fancy almost as well as it did Ganymede’s, who enjoyed
the secret jest in knowing these fine love-speeches were all
addressed to the right person.</p>

<p>In this manner many days passed pleasantly on with these
young people; and the good-natured Aliena, seeing it made Ganymede
happy, let him have his own way, and was diverted at the
mock-courtship, and did not care to remind Ganymede that the
lady Rosalind had not yet made herself known to the duke her
father, whose place of resort in the forest they had learnt from
Orlando. Ganymede met the duke one day, and had some talk
with him, and the duke asked of what parentage he came. Ganymede
answered that he came of as good parentage as he did, which
made the duke smile, for he did not suspect the pretty shepherd-boy
came of royal lineage. Then seeing the duke look well and
happy, Ganymede was content to put off all further explanation
for a few days longer.</p>

<p>One morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede, he
saw a man lying asleep on the ground, and a large green snake had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
twisted itself about his neck. The snake, seeing Orlando approach,
glided away among the bushes. Orlando went nearer, and then
he discovered a lioness lie crouching, with her head on the ground,
with a cat-like watch, waiting until the sleeping man awaked
(for it is said that lions will prey on nothing that is dead or
sleeping). It seemed as if Orlando was sent by Providence to
free the man from the danger of the snake and lioness; but when
Orlando looked in the man’s face, he perceived that the sleeper
who was exposed to this double peril, was his own brother Oliver,
who had so cruelly used him, and had threatened to destroy him
by fire; and he was almost tempted to leave him a prey to the
hungry lioness; but brotherly affection and the gentleness of his
nature soon overcame his first anger against his brother; and he
drew his sword, and attacked the lioness, and slew her, and thus
preserved his brother’s life both from the venomous snake and
from the furious lioness; but before Orlando could conquer the
lioness, she had torn one of his arms with her sharp claws.</p>

<p>While Orlando was engaged with the lioness, Oliver awaked,
and perceiving that his brother Orlando, whom he had so cruelly
treated, was saving him from the fury of a wild beast at the risk
of his own life, shame and remorse at once seized him, and he
repented of his unworthy conduct, and besought with many tears
his brother’s pardon for the injuries he had done him. Orlando
rejoiced to see him so penitent, and readily forgave him; they
embraced each other; and from that hour Oliver loved Orlando
with a true brotherly affection, though he had come to the forest
<a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref455">bent on his destruction</a>.</p>

<p>The wound in Orlando’s arm having bled very much, he found
himself too weak to go to visit Ganymede, and therefore he
desired his brother to go and tell Ganymede, “whom,” said Orlando,
“I in sport do call my Rosalind,” the accident which had
befallen him.</p>

<p>Thither then Oliver went, and told to Ganymede and Aliena
how Orlando had saved his life; and when he had finished the
story of Orlando’s bravery, and his own providential escape, he
owned to them that he was Orlando’s brother, who had so cruelly
used him; and then he told them of their reconciliation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>The sincere sorrow that Oliver expressed for his offenses made
such a lively impression on the kind heart of Aliena, that she
instantly fell in love with him; and Oliver observing how much she
pitied the distress he told her he felt for his fault, he as suddenly
fell in love with her. But while love was thus stealing into the
hearts of Aliena and Oliver, he was no less busy with Ganymede,
who hearing of the danger Orlando had been in, and that he was
wounded by the lioness, fainted; and when he recovered, he pretended
that he had <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref456">counterfeited the swoon</a> in the imaginary character
of Rosalind, and Ganymede said to Oliver, “Tell your
brother Orlando how well I counterfeited a swoon.” But Oliver
saw by the paleness of his complexion that he did really faint,
and much wondering at the weakness of the young man, he said,
“Well, if you did counterfeit, take a good heart, and counterfeit to
be a man.” “So I do,” replied Ganymede, truly, “but I should
have been a woman by right.”</p>

<p>Oliver made this visit a very long one, and when at last he
returned back to his brother, he had much news to tell him; for
besides the account of Ganymede’s fainting at the hearing that
Orlando was wounded, Oliver told him how he had fallen in love
with the fair shepherdess Aliena, and that she had lent a favorable
ear to his suit, even in this their first interview; and he talked to
his brother, as of a thing almost settled, that he should marry
Aliena, saying, that he so well loved her, that he would live here
as a shepherd, and settle his estate and house at home upon
Orlando.</p>

<p>“You have my consent,” said Orlando. “Let your wedding be
tomorrow, and I will invite the duke and his friends. Go and persuade
your shepherdess to agree to this; she is now alone; for
look, here comes her brother.” Oliver went to Aliena; and Ganymede,
whom Orlando had perceived approaching, came to inquire
after the health of his wounded friend.</p>

<p>When Orlando and Ganymede began to talk over the sudden
love which had taken place between Oliver and Aliena, Orlando
said he had advised his brother to persuade his fair shepherdess
to be married on the morrow, and then he added how much he
could wish to be married on the same day to his Rosalind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Ganymede, who well approved of this arrangement, said that
if Orlando really loved Rosalind as well as he professed to do, he
should have his wish; for on the morrow he would engage to make
Rosalind appear in her own person, and also that Rosalind should
be willing to marry Orlando.</p>

<p>This seemingly wonderful event, which, as Ganymede was the
lady Rosalind, he could so easily perform, he pretended he would
bring to pass by the aid of magic, which he said he had learnt
of an uncle who was a famous magician.</p>

<p>The fond lover Orlando, half believing and half doubting what
he heard, asked Ganymede if he spoke in sober meaning. “By my
life I do,” said Ganymede; “therefore put on your best clothes,
and bid the duke and your friends to your wedding; for if you
desire to be married tomorrow to Rosalind, she shall be here.”</p>

<p>The next morning, Oliver having obtained the consent of
Aliena, they came into the presence of the duke, and with them
also came Orlando.</p>

<p>They being all assembled to celebrate this double marriage,
and as yet only one of the brides appearing, there was much of
<a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref457">wondering and conjecture</a>, but they mostly thought that Ganymede
was making a jest of Orlando.</p>

<p>The duke, hearing that it was his own daughter that was to be
brought in this strange way, asked Orlando if he believed the
shepherd-boy could really do what he had promised; and while
Orlando was answering that he knew not what to think, Ganymede
entered, and asked the duke, if he brought his daughter,
whether he would consent to her marriage with Orlando. “That
I would,” said the duke, “if I had kingdoms to give with her.”
Ganymede then said to Orlando, “And you say you will marry her
if I bring her here?” “That I would,” said Orlando, “if I were
king of many kingdoms.”</p>

<p>Ganymede and Aliena then went out together, and Ganymede
throwing off his male attire, and being once more dressed in
woman’s apparel, quickly became Rosalind without the power of
magic; and Aliena changing her country garb for her own rich
clothes, was with as little trouble transformed into the lady Celia.</p>

<p>While they were gone, the duke said to Orlando, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
thought the shepherd Ganymede very like his daughter Rosalind;
and Orlando said, he also had observed the resemblance.</p>

<p>They had no time to wonder how all this would end, for Rosalind
and Celia in their own clothes entered; and no longer pretending
that it was by the power of magic that she came there, Rosalind
threw herself on her knees before her father, and begged his
blessing. It seemed so wonderful to all present that she should
so suddenly appear, that it might well have passed for magic; but
Rosalind would no longer trifle with her father, and told him the
story of her banishment, and of her dwelling in the forest as a
shepherd-boy, her cousin Celia passing as her sister.</p>

<p>The duke <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref458">ratified the consent</a> he had already given to the marriage;
and Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia, were married
at the same time. And though their wedding could not be celebrated
in this wild forest with any of the parade or splendor usual
on such occasions, yet a happier wedding-day was never passed;
and while they were eating their venison under the cool shade of
the pleasant trees, as if nothing should be wanting to complete
the felicity of this good duke and the true lovers, an unexpected
messenger arrived to tell the duke the joyful news, that his
dukedom was restored to him.</p>

<p>The usurper, enraged at the flight of his daughter Celia, and
hearing that every day men of great worth resorted to the forest
of Arden to join the lawful duke in his exile, much envying that
his brother should be so highly <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref459">respected in his adversity</a>, put himself
at the head of a large force, and advanced toward the forest,
intending to seize his brother, and put him with all his faithful
followers to the sword; but, by a <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref460">wonderful interposition</a> of Providence,
this bad brother was converted from his evil intention; for
just as he entered the skirts of the wild forest, he was met by an
old religious man, a hermit, with whom he had much talk, and
who in the end completely turned his heart from his wicked design.
Thenceforward he became a true penitent, and resolved, relinquishing
his unjust dominion, to spend the remainder of his days
in a religious house. The first act of his <a href="#phrases41" title="List of phrases" id="ref461">newly-conceived penitence</a>
was to send a messenger to his brother (as has been related)
to offer to restore to him his dukedom, which he had usurped so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
long, and with it the lands and revenues of his friends, the faithful
followers of his adversity.</p>

<p>This joyful news, as unexpected as it was welcome, came opportunely
to heighten the festivity and rejoicings at the wedding
of the princesses. Celia complimented her cousin on this good
fortune which had happened to the duke, Rosalind’s father, and
wished her joy very sincerely, though she herself was no longer
heir to the dukedom, but by this restoration which her father had
made, Rosalind was now the heir; so completely was the love of
these two cousins unmixed with anything of jealousy or of envy.</p>

<p>The duke had now an opportunity of rewarding those true
friends who had stayed with him in his banishment; and these
worthy followers, though they had patiently shared his adverse
fortune, were very well pleased to return in peace and prosperity
to the palace of their lawful duke.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Charles Lamb (1775-1834) was an English writer who
spent his entire life in London. He was a classmate of the poet Coleridge.

<h4>THE TEMPEST</h4>

<p class="author">CHARLES AND MARY LAMB</p>

<p>There was a certain island in the sea, the only inhabitants
of which were an old man, whose name was Prospero, and his
daughter Miranda, a very beautiful young lady. She came to
this island so young that she had no memory of having seen any
other human face than her father’s.</p>

<p>They lived in a cave, or cell, made out of a rock; it was divided
into several apartments, one of which Prospero called his study;
there he kept his books, which chiefly treated of magic, a study
at that time <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref462">much affected by all learned men</a>. The knowledge
of this art he found very useful to him; for being thrown by a
strange chance upon this island, which had been enchanted by a
witch called Sycorax, who died there a short time before his
arrival, Prospero, by virtue of his art, released many good spirits
that Sycorax had imprisoned in the bodies of large trees, because
they had <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref463">refused to execute</a> her wicked commands. These gentle
spirits were ever after obedient to the will of Prospero. Of these
Ariel was the chief.</p>

<p>The lively little sprite Ariel had nothing mischievous in his
nature, except that he took rather too much pleasure in tormenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
an ugly monster called Caliban, for he <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref464">owed him a grudge</a>
because he was the son of his old enemy Sycorax. This Caliban,
Prospero found in the woods, a strange misshapen thing, far less
human in form than an ape. He took him home to his cell, and
taught him to speak; and Prospero would have been very kind
to him, but the bad nature which Caliban inherited from his
mother Sycorax, would not let him learn anything good or useful;
therefore he was employed like a slave, to fetch wood, and
do the most laborious offices; and Ariel had the charge of compelling
him to these services.</p>

<p>When Caliban was lazy and neglected his work, Ariel (who
was invisible to all eyes but Prospero’s) would come slyly and
pinch him, and sometimes tumble him down in the mire; and then
Ariel, in the likeness of an ape, would make mouths at him.
Then swiftly changing his shape, in the likeness of a hedgehog,
he would lie tumbling in Caliban’s way, who feared the hedgehog’s
sharp quills would prick his bare feet. With a variety of <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref465">such-like
vexatious tricks</a> Ariel would often torment him, whenever
Caliban neglected the work which Prospero commanded him to do.</p>

<p>Having these powerful spirits obedient to his will, Prospero
could by their means command the winds, and the waves of the
sea. By his orders they raised a violent storm, in the midst of
which, and struggling with the wild sea-waves that every moment
threatened to swallow it up, he showed his daughter a fine large
ship, which he told her was full of living beings like themselves.
“O my dear father,” said she, “if by your art you have raised
this dreadful storm, have pity on their sad distress. See! the vessel
will be dashed to pieces. Poor souls! they will all perish. If
I had power, I would sink the sea beneath the earth, rather than
the good ship should be destroyed, with all the precious souls
within her.”</p>

<p>“Be not so amazed, daughter Miranda,” said Prospero; “there
is no harm done. I have so ordered it, that no person in the ship
shall receive any hurt. What I have done has been in care of
you, my dear child. You are ignorant who you are, or where you
came from, and you know no more of me but that I am your
father, and live in this poor cave. Can you remember a time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
before you came to this cell? I think you cannot, for you were
not then three years of age.”</p>

<p>“Certainly I can, sir,” replied Miranda.</p>

<p>“By what?” asked Prospero; “by any other house or person?
Tell me what you can remember, my child.”</p>

<p>Miranda said, “It seems to me like the recollection of a dream.
But had I not once four or five women who attended upon me?”</p>

<p>Prospero answered, “You had, and more. How is it that this
still lives in your mind? Do you remember how you came here?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Miranda, “I remember nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Twelve years ago, Miranda,” continued Prospero, “I was
duke of Milan, and you were a princess, and my only heir. I had
a younger brother, whose name was Antonio, to whom I trusted
everything; and as I was fond of retirement and deep study, I
commonly left the management of my state affairs to your uncle,
my false brother (for so indeed he proved). I, neglecting all
<a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref466">worldly ends</a>, buried among my books, did <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref467">dedicate my whole
time</a> to the bettering of my mind. My brother Antonio being thus
in possession of my power, began to think himself the duke indeed.
The opportunity I gave him of making himself popular among
my subjects awakened in his bad nature a proud ambition to
deprive me of my dukedom; this he soon effected with the aid
of the king of Naples, a powerful prince, who was my enemy.”</p>

<p>“Wherefore,” said Miranda, “did they not that hour destroy
us?”</p>

<p>“My child,” answered her father, “they durst not, so dear was
the love that my people bore me. Antonio carried us on board
a ship, and when we were some leagues out at sea, he forced us
into a small boat, without either tackle, sail, or mast; there he
left us, as he thought, to perish. But a kind lord of my court,
one Gonzalo, who loved me, had privately placed in the boat,
water, provisions, apparel, and some books which I prize above my
dukedom.”</p>

<p>“O my father,” said Miranda, “what a trouble must I have
been to you then!”</p>

<p>“No, my love,” said Prospero, “you were a little cherub that
did preserve me. Your innocent smiles made me bear up against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
my misfortunes. Our food lasted till we landed on this desert
island, since when my chief delight has been in teaching you,
Miranda, and well have you profited by my instructions.”</p>

<p>“Heaven thank you, my dear father,” said Miranda. “Now
pray tell me, sir, your reason for raising this sea-storm?”</p>

<p>“Know then,” said her father, “that by means of this storm,
my enemies, the King of Naples and my cruel brother, are cast
ashore upon this island.”</p>

<p>Having so said, Prospero gently touched his daughter with
his magic wand, and she fell fast asleep; for the spirit Ariel just
then presented himself before his master, to give an account of
the tempest, and how he had disposed of the ship’s company, and
though the spirits were always invisible to Miranda, Prospero did
not choose she should hear him <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref468">holding converse</a> (as would seem
to her) with the empty air.</p>

<p>“Well, my brave spirit,” said Prospero to Ariel, “how have you
performed your task?”</p>

<p>Ariel gave a lively description of the storm, and of the terrors
of the mariners; and how the King’s son, Ferdinand, was the first
who leaped into the sea; and his father thought he saw his dear
son swallowed up by the waves and lost. “But he is safe,” said
Ariel, “in a corner of the isle, sitting with his arms folded, sadly
<a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref469">lamenting the loss</a> of the King, his father, whom he concludes
drowned. Not a hair of his head is injured, and his princely
garments, though drenched in the sea-waves, look fresher than
before.”</p>

<p>“That’s my delicate Ariel,” said Prospero. “Bring him hither;
my daughter must see this young prince. Where is the King, and
my brother?”</p>

<p>“I left them,” answered Ariel, “searching for Ferdinand, whom
they have little hopes of finding, thinking they saw him perish.
Of the ship’s crew not one is missing; though each one thinks himself
the only one saved; and the ship, though invisible to them,
is safe in the harbor.”</p>

<p>“Ariel,” said Prospero, “thy charge is faithfully performed;
but there is more work yet.”</p>

<p>“Is there more work?” said Ariel. “Let me remind you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
master, you have promised me my liberty. I pray remember I
have done you worthy service, told you no lies, made no mistakes,
served you without grudge or grumbling.”</p>

<p>“How now!” said Prospero. “You do not recollect what a
torment I freed you from. Have you forgot the wicked witch
Sycorax, who with age and envy was almost bent double? Where
was she born? Speak; tell me.”</p>

<p>“Sir, in Algiers,” said Ariel.</p>

<p>“O was she so?” said Prospero. “I must recount what you
have been, which I find you do not remember. This bad witch,
Sycorax, for her witchcrafts, too terrible to enter human hearing,
was banished from Algiers, and here left by the sailors; and
because you were a spirit too delicate to execute her wicked commands,
she shut you up in a tree, where I found you howling.
This torment, remember, I did free you from.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, dear master,” said Ariel, ashamed to seem ungrateful;
“I will obey your commands.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” said Prospero, “and I will set you free.” He then
gave orders what further he would have him do; and away went
Ariel, first to where he had left Ferdinand, and found him still
sitting on the grass in the same melancholy posture.</p>

<p>“O my young gentleman,” said Ariel, when he saw him, “I will
soon move you. You must be brought, I find, for the Lady
Miranda to have a sight of your pretty person. Come, sir, follow
me.” He then began singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Full fathom five thy father lies;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Of his bones are coral made;</div>
<div class="verse">Those are pearls that were his eyes.</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Nothing of him that doth fade,</div>

<div class="verse">Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell;</div>
<div class="verse">Hark! now I hear them,—Ding-dong, bell.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This strange news of his lost father soon roused the prince
from the stupid fit into which he had fallen. He followed in
amazement the sound of Ariel’s voice, till it led him to Prospero
and Miranda, who were sitting under the shade of a large tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Now Miranda had never seen a man before, except her own
father.</p>

<p>“Miranda,” said Prospero, “tell me what you are looking at
yonder.”</p>

<p>“O father,” said Miranda, in a strange surprise, “surely that
is a spirit. Lord! how it looks about! Believe me, sir, it is a
beautiful creature. Is it not a spirit?”</p>

<p>“No, girl,” answered her father; “it eats, and sleeps, and has
senses such as we have. This young man you see was in the ship.
He is somewhat <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref470">altered by grief</a>, or you might call him a handsome
person. He has lost his companions, and is wandering about to
find them.”</p>

<p>Miranda, who thought all men had grave faces and gray
beards like her father, was delighted with the appearance of this
beautiful young prince; and Ferdinand, seeing such a lovely lady
in this desert place, and from the strange sounds he had heard,
expecting nothing but wonders, thought he was upon an enchanted
island, and that Miranda was the goddess of the place, and as
such he began to address her.</p>

<p>She timidly answered, she was no goddess, but a simple maid,
and was going to give him an account of herself, when Prospero
interrupted her. He was well pleased to find they admired each
other, for he plainly perceived they had (as we say) fallen in
love at first sight; but to try Ferdinand’s constancy, he resolved
to throw some difficulties in their way; therefore advancing forward,
he addressed the prince with a stern air, telling him, he
came to the island as a spy, to take it from him who was the
lord of it. “Follow me,” said he, “I will tie you neck and feet
together. You shall drink sea-water; shell-fish, withered roots,
and husks of acorns shall be your food.” “No,” said Ferdinand,
“I will resist such entertainment, till I see a more powerful
enemy,” and drew his sword; but Prospero, waving his magic
wand, fixed him to the spot where he stood, so that he had no
power to move.</p>

<p>Miranda hung upon her father, saying, “Why are you so
ungentle? Have pity, sir; I will be his surety. This is the second
man I ever saw, and to me he seems a true one.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Silence,” said the father; “one word more will make me chide
you, girl! What! an <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref471">advocate for an impostor</a>! You think there
are no more such fine men, having seen only him and Caliban.
I tell you, foolish girl, most men as far excel this, as he does
Caliban.” This he said to prove his daughter’s constancy; and
she replied, “My affections are most humble. I have no wish
to see a goodlier man.”</p>

<p>“Come on, young man,” said Prospero to the Prince; “you
have no power to disobey me.”</p>

<p>“I have not indeed,” answered Ferdinand; and not knowing
that it was by magic he was deprived of all <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref472">power of resistance</a>,
he was astonished to find himself so strangely compelled to follow
Prospero; looking back on Miranda as long as he could see
her, he said, as he went after Prospero into the cave, “My spirits
are all bound up, as if I were in a dream; but this man’s threats,
and the weakness which I feel, would seem light to me if from
my prison I might once a day behold this fair maid.”</p>

<p>Prospero kept Ferdinand not long confined within the cell; he
soon brought out his prisoner, and <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref473">set him a severe task</a> to perform,
taking care to let his daughter know the hard labor he
had imposed on him, and then pretending to go into his study, he
secretly watched them both.</p>

<p>Prospero had commanded Ferdinand to pile up some heavy
logs of wood. Kings’ sons not being much used to laborious work,
Miranda soon after found her lover almost dying with fatigue.
“Alas!” said she, “do not work so hard; my father is at his studies,
he is safe for these three hours; pray rest yourself.”</p>

<p>“O my dear lady,” said Ferdinand, “I dare not. I must finish
my task before I take my rest.”</p>

<p>“If you will sit down,” said Miranda, “I will carry your logs
the while.” But this Ferdinand would by no means agree to.
Instead of a help Miranda <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref474">became a hindrance</a>, for they began
a long conversation, so that the business of log-carrying went
on very slowly.</p>

<p>Prospero, who <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref475">had enjoined</a> Ferdinand this task merely as a
trial of his love, was not at his books, as his daughter supposed,
but was standing by them invisible, to overhear what they said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferdinand inquired her name, which she told, saying it was
against her father’s express command she did so.</p>

<p>Prospero only smiled at this first instance of his daughter’s
disobedience, for having by his magic art caused his daughter
to fall in love so suddenly, he was not angry that she showed
her love by forgetting to obey his commands. And he listened
well pleased to a long speech of Ferdinand’s, in which he professed
to love her above all the ladies he ever saw.</p>

<p>In answer to his praises of her beauty, which he said exceeded
all the women in the world, she replied, “I do not remember the
face of any woman, nor have I seen any more men than you, my
good friend, and my dear father. How features are abroad, I
know not; but, believe me, sir, I would not wish any companion
in the world but you, nor can my imagination form any shape
but yours that I could like. But, sir, I fear I talk to you too
freely, and my <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref476">father’s precepts</a> I forget.”</p>

<p>At this Prospero smiled, and nodded his head, as much as to
say, “This goes on exactly as I could wish; my girl will be Queen
of Naples.”</p>

<p>And then Ferdinand, in another fine long speech (for young
princes speak in courtly phrases), told the innocent Miranda he
was heir to the crown of Naples, and that she should be his
Queen.</p>

<p>“Ah! sir,” said she, “I am a fool to weep at what I am glad
of. I will answer you in plain and holy innocence. I am your
wife if you will marry me.”</p>

<p>Prospero prevented Ferdinand’s thanks by appearing visible
before them.</p>

<p>“Fear nothing, my child,” said he; “I have overheard, and
so approve of all you have said. And, Ferdinand, if I have too
severely used you, I will make you rich amends, by giving you
my daughter. All your vexations were but trials of your love,
and you have nobly stood the test. Then as my gift, which
your true love has worthily purchased, take my daughter, and
do not smile that I boast she is above all praise.” He then,
telling them that he had business which required his presence,
desired they would sit down and talk together till he returned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
and this command Miranda seemed not at all disposed to
disobey.</p>

<p>When Prospero left them, he called his spirit Ariel, who
quickly appeared before him, eager to relate what he had done
with Prospero’s brother and the King of Naples. Ariel said he
had left them almost out of their senses with fear, at the strange
things he had caused them to see and hear. When fatigued with
wandering about, and famished for want of food, he had suddenly
set before them a delicious banquet, and then, just as they were
going to eat, he appeared visible before them in the shape of
a harpy, a voracious monster with wings, and the feast vanished
away. Then, to their utter amazement, this seeming harpy spoke
to them, reminding them of their cruelty in driving Prospero from
his dukedom, and leaving him and his infant daughter to perish
in the sea; saying, that for this cause these terrors were suffered
to afflict them.</p>

<p>The King of Naples, and Antonio, the false brother, repented
the injustice they had done to Prospero; and Ariel told his master
he was certain their <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref477">penitence was sincere</a>, and that he, though a
spirit, could not but pity them.</p>

<p>“Then bring them hither, Ariel,” said Prospero; “if you, who
are but a spirit, feel for their distress, shall not I, who am a human
being like themselves, <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref478">have compassion</a> on them? Bring them,
quickly, my dainty Ariel.”</p>

<p>Ariel soon returned with the King, Antonio, and old Gonzalo
in their train, who had followed him, wondering at the wild music
he played in the air to draw them on to his master’s presence.
This Gonzalo was the same who had so kindly provided Prospero
formerly with books and provisions, when his wicked brother
left him, as he thought, to perish in an open boat in the sea.</p>

<p>Grief and terror had so <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref479">stupefied their senses</a>, that they did
not know Prospero. He first discovered himself to the good old
Gonzalo, calling him the preserver of his life; and then his brother
and the King knew that he was the injured Prospero.</p>

<p>Antonio with tears, and sad words of sorrow and true repentance,
implored his brother’s forgiveness, and the King expressed
his sincere remorse for having assisted Antonio to depose his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
brother; and Prospero forgave them; and, upon their <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref480">engaging to
restore</a> his dukedom, he said to the King of Naples, “I have a gift
in store for you, too”; and opening a door, showed him his son
Ferdinand playing at chess with Miranda.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the joy of the father and the son at this
unexpected meeting, for they each thought the other drowned in
the storm.</p>

<p>“O wonder!” said Miranda, “what noble creatures these are!
It must surely be a brave world that has such people in it.”</p>

<p>The King of Naples was almost as much astonished at the
beauty and excellent graces of the young Miranda, as his son
had been. “Who is this maid?” said he; “she seems the goddess
that has parted us, and brought us thus together.” “No, sir,”
answered Ferdinand, smiling to find his father had fallen into the
same mistake that he had done when he first saw Miranda, “she
is a mortal, but by immortal Providence she is mine; I chose her
when I could not ask you, my father, for your consent, not thinking
you were alive. She is the daughter to this Prospero, who is
the famous duke of Milan, of whose renown I have heard so
much, but never saw him till now; of him I have received a new
life: he has made himself to me a second father, giving me this
dear lady.”</p>

<p>“Then I must be her father,” said the King; “but oh! how
oddly will it sound, that I must ask my child forgiveness.”</p>

<p>“No more of that,” said Prospero; “let us not remember our
troubles past, since they so happily have ended.” And then Prospero
embraced his brother, and again assured him of his forgiveness;
and said that a wise over-ruling Providence had permitted
that he should be driven from his poor dukedom of Milan,
that his daughter might inherit the crown of Naples, for that by
their meeting in this desert island, it had happened that the King’s
son had loved Miranda.</p>

<p>These kind words which Prospero spoke, meaning to comfort
his brother, so filled Antonio with shame and remorse, that he
wept and was unable to speak; and the kind old Gonzalo wept to
see this joyful reconciliation, and prayed for blessings on the
young couple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Prospero now told them that their ship was safe in the harbor,
and the sailors all on board her, and that he and his daughter
would accompany them home the next morning. “In the
meantime,” says he, “partake of such refreshments as my poor
cave affords; and for your evening’s entertainment I will relate
the history of my life from my first landing in this desert island.”
He then called for Caliban to prepare some food, and set the cave
in order; and the company were astonished at the <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref481">uncouth form</a>
and savage appearance of this ugly monster, who (Prospero said)
was the only attendant he had to wait upon him.</p>

<p>Before Prospero left the island, he dismissed Ariel from his
service, to the great joy of that lively little spirit; who, though
he had been a faithful servant to his master, was always longing
to enjoy his free liberty, to wander uncontrolled in the air, like
a wild bird, under green trees, among pleasant fruits, and sweet-smelling
flowers. “My quaint Ariel,” said Prospero to the little
sprite when he made him free, “I shall miss you; yet you shall
have your freedom.” “Thank you, my dear master,” said Ariel;
“but give me leave to attend your ship home with <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref482">prosperous
gales</a>, before you bid farewell to the assistance of your faithful
spirit; and then, master, when I am free, how merrily I shall
live!” Here Ariel sang this pretty song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“Where the bee sucks, there suck I;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">In a cowslip’s bell I lie;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">There I crouch when owls do cry.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">On the bat’s back I do fly</div>
<div class="verse indent1">After summer merrily.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Merrily, merrily shall I live now</div>
<div class="verse">Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Prospero then buried deep in the earth his magical books and
wand, for he was resolved never more to make use of the magic
art. And having thus overcome his enemies, and being reconciled
to his brother and the King of Naples, nothing now remained to
complete his happiness, but to revisit his native land, to take
possession of his dukedom, and to witness the <a href="#phrases42" title="List of phrases" id="ref483">happy nuptials</a> of
his daughter and Prince Ferdinand, which the King said should
be instantly celebrated with great splendor on their return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Naples. At which place, under the safe convoy of the spirit
Ariel, they, after a pleasant voyage, soon arrived.</p>

<p>These lines remind us of the great inheritance, not alone of
Englishmen but of all who speak the English tongue, whether
they live in the United States or England, in Canada or in
Australia. This inheritance is due to the fact that English-speaking
peoples govern themselves, that they were the first to
invent the means by which free government became possible.
It sometimes seems a simple thing, very much a matter of course,
that in America the rulers are all the people, who adopt the laws
they desire; who submit to rules of life because they themselves
think these rules to be wise, not because they are compelled to
submit through the will of an emperor. But in reality this free
government, this democracy, has grown very slowly, through
centuries. It is an inheritance of freedom.</p>

<p>The story of this inheritance is filled with deeds of heroes.
These heroes lived and died, not to win glory for themselves, but
to win freedom for their fellows. Sometimes they were English
barons, daring to defy a wicked king, and forcing him to sign a
Great Charter that gave them a share in the government. Sometimes
they were the peasants seeking the right to live more comfortably.
Sometimes they were statesmen who secured for Parliament
the right to levy taxes and to be consulted about the
way England was to be ruled, and the right to drive a selfish
tyrant from the throne. And sometimes they were the farmers
and village men forming in battle line at Lexington and Concord.
It is a long story that you will read, in many places, not all of
it at one time; but little by little you will come to see what
meaning lies in the simple words “our inheritance of freedom,”
and then you will be ready to give your time, and if need be,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
your life, to keep this inheritance and to hand it on to those who
will speak the English tongue when you are dead.</p>

<p>Only a few bits of the story can be given here. You will
read something about Scotland’s struggle for the right to be
governed by her own people, not by the tyrannical kings who
then ruled England and who looked upon Scotland as a mere
province fit only to supply money for their selfish desires. Next
you will read several selections which show that the tyranny
against which Wallace and Bruce fought, like the tyranny against
which Warren and Washington and Patrick Henry fought, did not
spring from the English spirit, but from kings who tried to keep
even Englishmen in slavery. It is all one story—at one time the
action takes place in Scotland, at another in England, at still
another time in America; but the story is the story of our
inheritance of freedom.</p>

<p>“We must be free or die”—these words express the spirit of
all who speak the English tongue. The stories of Wallace and
Bruce tell it. The story of the last fight of the <i>Revenge</i> tells
it—a story written by the man who first began to plant English
colonies in America, and who helped defend England against
the tyranny which King Philip of Spain tried to establish. The
stories of the Gray Champion, and of Warren at Bunker Hill,
and of Patrick Henry of Virginia, and of Washington and Marion,
are also a part of the great story of our inheritance of freedom.</p>

<p>You should keep this always in mind: the heroes who made
good the Declaration of Independence and set up a new and freer
government in America were men whose ideals of freedom came to
them from England. They did not fight against the English
<em>people</em>. Their spirit was also the fundamental English spirit.
Many of the greatest Englishmen of that period used every effort
to win fair treatment for the colonies, sympathized with their
struggle for independence and rejoiced when at last George III and
his ministers were told that America would no longer submit to
oppression.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of these Englishmen was Edmund Burke,
who lived in the time of George III and took the part of the colonies
in their struggle against the King’s tyranny. He worked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the repeal of the taxation laws that so offended the Americans.
He made many speeches in Parliament and elsewhere pleading
with Englishmen not to drive their fellow Englishmen into civil
war. And when at last war came, Burke still sought to bring
about reconciliation. He wrote the King a letter in which he
said that the British government was not representing the British
spirit of freedom in its dealings with the colonies. He wrote a
letter to the colonies in which he begged them not to believe that
they were at war with England. “Do not think,” he said, “that
the whole or even the majority of Englishmen in the island are
enemies to their own blood on the American continent.” And
a little later he said, “But still a large, and we trust the largest
and soundest part of this kingdom perseveres in the most perfect
unity of sentiments, principles, and affections with you. <em>It
spreads out a large and liberal platform of common liberty upon
which we may all unite forever.</em>” The whole matter he sums up
by saying that the spirit of England loves not conquest or vast
empire for the sake of wealth, but “this is the peculiar glory of
England: those who have and who hold to that foundation of common
liberty, whether on this or on your side of the ocean, we
consider as the true, and the only true, Englishmen.”</p>

<p>All Americans need to remember these words written by a great
friend of the colonies during the Revolutionary War, a man who
also explained more clearly and more eloquently than any other
Englishman in any time the principles on which our inheritance
of freedom rests. His interest in the American cause was not
merely the interest of a sympathetic friend; over and over again
he pointed out that the colonies, and not the King’s ministry,
represented the true English spirit. To him the mode of self-government
set up in Massachusetts and Virginia represented
the very ideal for which patriotic Englishmen had struggled for
centuries. The British parliament, in Burke’s time, was not
made up of representatives from all the population; only a small
part of the population could vote, and many districts had no
representation at all. Complete control of the government by
the people was what Burke and thousands of other Englishmen
had been trying to win. In America such a form of popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
government had developed freely, because the British King paid
little attention to the colonies until they became wealthy enough
to be a source of riches. It was this fact that made the American
revolution not merely a war for the establishment of a new
nation, but quite as much a war for the development of free
government in England itself. Burke realized this fact, and
expressed it by saying, “We view the establishment of the English
colonies on principles of liberty as that which is to render
this kingdom venerable to future ages.”</p>

<p>The prophecy has been fulfilled. Britain still has a king, but he
is king in name only; the real power rests in the people. The
struggle in which the American colonists bore a part has resulted
not only in a free America, but also in a free England and in freedom
for the great dominions—Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—which
have much the same form of government. The
inheritance of freedom belongs to all English-speaking peoples,
and the spread of these ideals means freedom for the world.</p>

<p>These ideals center around the brotherhood of man. In our
Revolutionary period Robert Burns sang of the coming of a time
when these ideals should be acknowledged:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“It’s coming yet, for a’ that,</div>
<div class="verse">That man to man, the world o’er,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall brothers be, for a’ that.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Long before the time of Burns, John Milton, a great poet,
who worked throughout his life for freedom, and who held the
same ideals as those held by the founders of Plymouth Colony,
wrote of the same thing: “Who knows not that there is a mutual
bond of brotherhood between man and man over all the world?”</p>

<p>The recent war has brought England and America together
once more, as defenders of the right of all people to self-government.
For English ideals, planted on American soil, victorious
over the tyranny of George III and his ministry, have
not only found their most complete development in our America,
but have given the vision of liberty to all men. Thus we are
able to understand what President Wilson meant when he said,
“And the heart of America shall interpret the heart of the world.”</p>

<h4>TALES OF A GRANDFATHER</h4>

<p class="author">SIR WALTER SCOTT</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Story of Sir William Wallace (1296-1305)</span></h5>

<p>William Wallace was none of the high nobles of Scotland, but
the son of a private gentleman, called Wallace of Ellerslie, in
Renfrewshire, near Paisley. He was very tall and handsome,
and one of the strongest and bravest men that ever lived. He
had a very fine countenance, with a quantity of fair hair, and
was <a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref484">particularly dexterous</a> in the use of all weapons which were
then employed in battle. Wallace, like all Scotsmen of high
spirit, had looked with great indignation upon the <a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref485">usurpation of
the crown</a> by Edward, and upon the insolences which the English
soldiers committed on his countrymen. It is said, that when he
was very young, he went a-fishing for sport in the river of Irvine,
near Ayr. He had caught a good many trout, which were carried
by a boy, who attended him with a fishing-basket, as is usual
with anglers. Two or three English soldiers, who belonged to the
garrison of Ayr, came up to Wallace, and insisted, with their
<a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref486">usual insolence</a>, on taking the fish from the boy. Wallace was
contented to allow them a part of the trout, but he refused to
part with the whole basketful. The soldiers insisted, and from
words came to blows. Wallace had no better weapon than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
butt-end of his fishing rod; but he struck the foremost of the Englishmen
so hard under the ear with it that he killed him on the
spot; and getting possession of the slain man’s sword, he fought
with so much fury that he put the others to flight, and brought
home his fish safe and sound. The English governor of Ayr
sought for him, to punish him with death for this action; but
Wallace lay concealed among the hills and great woods till the
matter was forgotten.</p>

<p>But the action which occasioned his finally rising in arms is
believed to have happened in the town of Lanark. Wallace was
at this time married to a lady of that place, and residing there
with his wife. It chanced, as he walked in the market-place,
dressed in a green garment, with a rich dagger by his side, that
an Englishman came up and insulted him on account of his
finery, saying a Scotsman had no business to wear so gay a dress,
or carry so handsome a weapon. It soon came to a quarrel, and
Wallace, having killed the Englishman, fled to his own house
which was speedily assaulted by all the English soldiers. While
they were endeavoring to force their way in at the front of the
house, Wallace escaped by a back door, and got in safety to a
rugged and rocky glen, near Lanark, called the Cartland Crags,
all covered with bushes and trees, and full of high precipices,
where he knew he should be safe from the pursuit of the English
soldiers. In the meantime the governor of Lanark, whose name
was Hazelrigg, burned Wallace’s house and put his wife and
servants to death; and by committing this cruelty, increased to
the highest pitch, as you may well believe, the hatred which the
champion had always borne against the English usurper. Hazelrigg
also proclaimed Wallace an outlaw, and offered a reward to
any one who should bring him to an English garrison, alive or
dead.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Wallace soon collected a body of men, outlawed
like himself, or willing to become so, rather than any
longer endure the oppression of the English. One of his earliest
expeditions was directed against Hazelrigg, whom he killed, and
thus avenged the death of his wife. He fought skirmishes with
the soldiers who were sent against him, and often defeated them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
and in time became so well known and so formidable, that multitudes
began to <a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref487">resort to his standard</a>, until at length he was at
the head of a considerable army, with which he proposed to
restore his country to independence.</p>

<p>Thus Wallace’s party grew daily stronger and stronger, and
many of the Scottish nobles joined with him. Among these was
Sir William Douglas, the Lord of Douglasdale, and the head of
a great family often mentioned in Scottish history. There was
also Sir John the Grahame, who became Wallace’s bosom friend
and greatest confidant. Many of these great noblemen, however,
deserted the cause of the country on the approach of John de
Warenne, Earl of Surrey, the English governor, at the head of a
numerous and well-appointed army. They thought that Wallace
would be unable to withstand the attack of so many disciplined
soldiers and hastened to submit themselves to the English, for
fear of losing their estates. Wallace, however, remained undismayed,
and at the head of a considerable army. He had taken
up his camp upon the northern side of the river Forth, near the
town of Stirling. The river was there crossed by a long wooden
bridge, about a mile above the spot where the present bridge is
situated.</p>

<p>The English general approached the banks of the river on the
southern side. He sent two clergymen to offer a pardon to Wallace
and his followers, on condition that they should lay down
their arms. But such was not the purpose of the <a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref488">high-minded
champion</a> of Scotland.</p>

<p>“Go back to Warenne,” said Wallace, “and tell him we value
not the pardon of the King of England. We are not here for the
purpose of treating for peace, but of abiding battle, and restoring
freedom to our country. Let the English come on; we defy
them to their very beards!”</p>

<p>The English, upon hearing this haughty answer, called loudly
to be led to the attack. The Earl of Surrey hesitated, for he was
a skillful soldier, and he saw that to approach the Scottish army,
his troops must pass over the long, narrow, wooden bridge; so
that those who should get over first might be attacked by Wallace
with all his forces, before those who remained behind could possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
come to their assistance. He therefore inclined to delay
the battle. But Cressingham the Treasurer, who was ignorant
and presumptuous, insisted that it was their duty to fight and
put an end to the war at once; and Surrey gave way to his opinion,
although Cressingham, being a churchman, could not be so
good a judge of what was fitting as he himself, an experienced
officer.</p>

<p>The English army began to cross the bridge, Cressingham
leading the van, or foremost division of the army; for, in those
military days, even clergymen wore armor and fought in battle.
That took place which Surrey had foreseen. Wallace suffered a
considerable part of the English army to pass the bridge, without
offering any opposition; but when about one-half were over, and
the bridge was crowded with those who were following, he charged
those who had crossed, with his whole strength, slew a very great
number, and drove the rest into the river Forth, where the greater
part were drowned. The remainder of the English army, who
were left on the southern bank of the river, fled in great confusion,
having first set fire to the wooden bridge, that the Scots might
not pursue them. Cressingham was killed in the very beginning
of the battle.</p>

<p>The remains of Surrey’s great army fled out of Scotland after
this defeat, and the Scots, taking arms on all sides, attacked the
castles in which the English soldiers continued to shelter themselves,
and took most of them by force or stratagem. Many wonderful
stories are told of Wallace’s exploits on these occasions,
some of which are no doubt true, while others are either invented
or very much exaggerated. It seems certain, however, that he
defeated the English in several combats, chased them almost
entirely out of Scotland, regained the towns and castles of which
they had possessed themselves, and recovered for a time the
complete freedom of the country.</p>

<p>Edward I was in Flanders when all these events took place.
You may suppose he was very angry when he learned that Scotland,
which he thought completely subdued, had risen into a great
insurrection against him, defeated his armies, killed his Treasurer,
chased his soldiers out of their country, and invaded England with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
a great force. He came back from Flanders in a mighty rage,
and determined not to leave that rebellious country until it was
finally conquered, for which purpose he assembled a very fine
army and marched into Scotland.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Scots prepared to defend themselves, and
chose Wallace to be Governor, or Protector, of the kingdom, because
they had no king at the time. He was now titled Sir William
Wallace, Protector, or Governor, of the Scottish nation.
But although Wallace, as we have seen, was the best soldier and
bravest man in Scotland, and therefore the most fit to be placed
in command at this critical period, when the King of England was
coming against them with such great forces, yet the nobles of
Scotland envied him this important situation, because he was not
a man born in high rank, or enjoying a large estate. So great
was their jealousy of Sir William Wallace, that many of these
great barons did not seem very willing to bring forward their
forces, or fight against the English, because they would not have
a man of inferior condition to be general. Yet, notwithstanding
this unwillingness of the great nobility to support him, Wallace
assembled a large army; for the middling, but especially the lower
classes, were very much attached to him. He marched boldly
against the King of England, and met him near the town of Falkirk.
Most of the Scottish army were on foot, because, as I
already told you, in those days only the nobility and great men
of Scotland fought on horseback. The English King, on the contrary,
had a very large body of the finest cavalry in the world,
Normans and English, all clothed in complete armor. He had
also the celebrated archers of England, each of whom was said to
carry twelve Scotsmen’s lives under his girdle; because every
archer had twelve arrows stuck in his belt, and was expected to
kill a man with every arrow.</p>

<p>The Scots had some good archers from the Forest of Ettrick,
who fought under command of Sir John Stewart of Bonkill;
but they were not nearly equal in number to the English. The
greater part of the Scottish army were on foot, armed with long
spears; they were placed thick and close together, and laid
all their spears so close, point over point, that it seemed as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
difficult to break through them, as through the wall of a strong
castle.</p>

<p>The English made the attack. King Edward, though he saw
the close ranks, and <a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref489">undaunted appearance</a>, of the Scottish infantry,
resolved nevertheless to try whether he could not ride
them down with his fine cavalry. He therefore gave his horsemen
orders to advance. They charged accordingly at full gallop.</p>

<p>The first line of cavalry was commanded by the Earl Marshal
of England, whose progress was checked by a morass. The second
line of English horse was commanded by Antony Beck, the
Bishop of Durham, who nevertheless wore armor and fought
like a lay baron. He wheeled round the morass; but when he saw
the deep and firm order of the Scots, his heart failed, and he proposed
to Sir Ralph Basset of Drayton, who commanded under
him, to halt till Edward himself brought up the reserve. “Go say
your mass, Bishop,” answered Basset contemptuously, and advanced
at full gallop with the second line. However, the Scots
stood their ground with their long spears; many of the foremost
of the English horses were thrown down, and the riders were killed
as they lay rolling, unable to rise, owing to the weight of their
heavy armor. The English cavalry attempted again and again
to disperse the deep and solid ranks in which Wallace had stationed
his foot soldiers. But they were repeatedly beaten off with
loss, nor could they make their way through that wood of spears,
as it is called by one of the English historians. King Edward
then commanded his archers to advance; and these approaching
within arrow-shot of the Scottish ranks, poured on them such close
and dreadful <a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref490">volleys of arrows</a>, that it was impossible to sustain
the discharge. It happened at the same time, that Sir John Stewart
was killed by a fall from his horse; and the archers of Ettrick
Forest, whom he was bringing forward to oppose those of King
Edward, were slain in great numbers around him. Their bodies
were afterward distinguished among the slain, as being the tallest
and handsomest men of the army.</p>

<p>The Scottish spearmen being thus thrown into some degree of
confusion, by the loss of those who were slain by the arrows of
the English, the heavy cavalry of Edward again charged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
more success than formerly, and broke through the ranks, which
were already disordered. Sir John Grahame, Wallace’s great
friend and companion, was slain, with many other brave soldiers;
and the Scots, having lost a very great number of men, were at
length obliged to take to flight.</p>

<p>The King of England possessed so much wealth, and so many
means of raising soldiers, that he sent army after army into the
poor oppressed country of Scotland, and obliged all its nobles and
great men, one after another, to submit themselves once more to
his yoke. Sir William Wallace, alone, or with a very small band
of followers, refused either to acknowledge the usurper Edward,
or to lay down his arms. He continued to maintain himself
among the woods and mountains of his native country for no less
than seven years after his defeat at Falkirk, and for more than
one year after all the other defenders of Scottish liberty had laid
down their arms. Many proclamations were sent out against him
by the English, and a great reward was set upon his head; for
Edward did not think he could have any secure possession of his
usurped kingdom of Scotland while Wallace lived. At length he
was taken prisoner; and, shame it to say, a Scotsman called Sir
John Monteith was the person by whom he was seized and delivered
to the English.</p>

<p>Edward, having thus obtained possession of the person whom
he considered as the greatest obstacle to his complete conquest of
Scotland, resolved to make Wallace an example to all Scottish
patriots who should in future venture to oppose his <a href="#phrases43" title="List of phrases" id="ref491">ambitious
projects</a>. He caused this gallant defender of his country to be
brought to trial in Westminster Hall, before the English judges,
and produced him there, crowned in mockery, with a green garland,
because they said he had been king of outlaws and robbers
among the Scottish woods. Wallace was accused of having been
a traitor to the English crown; to which he answered, “I could
not be a traitor to Edward, for I was never his subject.” He
was then charged with having taken and burned towns and castles,
with having killed many men and done much violence. He replied,
with the same calm resolution, that it was true he had
killed many Englishmen, but it was because they had come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
subdue and oppress his native country of Scotland; and far from
repenting what he had done, he declared he was only sorry that
he had not put to death many more of them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that Wallace’s defense was a good one, both
in law and in common sense (for surely every one has not only
a right to fight in defense of his native country, but is bound in
duty to do so), the English judges condemned him to be executed.</p>

<h6>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h6>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Walter Scott (1771-1832) was born in Edinburgh, Scotland.
Even in his childhood he loved nothing better than to wander through
Scotland, looking up castles and ruins and listening to the stories connected
with them as told by the old people of the villages. He became familiar
with all the ballads and legends of his locality, and these, with Bishop
Percy’s collection of ballads which he read later, exerted a strong influence
on his life. He loved the history and romance of Scotland and made them
known to all the world through his poems and novels.</p>

<p>In 1827 he published the <cite>Tales of a Grandfather</cite>, because, as he writes
in his diary, the good thought came to him to write stories from the history
of Scotland for his grandson, John Hugh Lockhart, whom he calls Hugh
Littlejohn. “Children hate books which are written down to their capacity,
and love those that are composed more for their elders. I will,” he says,
“make, if possible, a book that a child shall understand, yet a man will feel
some temptation to peruse should he chance to take it up.”</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. This story relates five episodes in the life of William
Wallace: The Basket of Fish; The Green Garment; The Wooden Bridge
at Stirling Town; A Wood of Spears; The Trial in Westminster Hall.
Relate the episode that seems most vivid to you. 2. Read three speeches
that show clearly the character of William Wallace. 3. Would you have
joined Wallace if you had been a Scottish nobleman? 4. Why did many of
the nobles refuse to join Wallace? 5. Describe the Scottish infantry and
archers, and the English cavalry and archers at Falkirk. 6. What is your
opinion of Sir John Monteith? 7. Locate on your map: Ayr; Lanark; Clyde
River; Stirling; Falkirk; Edinburgh; Northumberland; London. 8. Pronounce
the following: usurpation; formidable; stratagem; exploits; undaunted;
morass.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Robert the Bruce (1305-1313)</span></h5>

<p>Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, and John Comyn, usually
called the Red Comyn, two great and powerful barons, had taken
part with Sir William Wallace in the wars against England; but,
after the defeat of Falkirk, being fearful of losing their great
estates, and considering the freedom of Scotland as beyond the
possibility of being recovered, both Bruce and Comyn had not
only submitted themselves to Edward, and acknowledged his title
as King of Scotland, but even borne arms, along with the English,
against such of their countrymen as still continued to <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref492">resist the
usurper</a>. But the feelings of Bruce concerning the <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref493">baseness of
this conduct</a> are said, by the old tradition of Scotland, to have
been awakened by the following incident. In one of the numerous
battles, or skirmishes, which took place at the time between
the English and their adherents on the one side, and the insurgent,
or patriotic, Scots upon the other, Robert the Bruce was present,
and assisted the English to gain the victory. After the battle
was over, he sat down to dinner among his southern friends and
allies, without washing his hands, on which there still remained
spots of the blood which he had shed during the action. The English
lords, observing this, whispered to each other in mockery,
“Look at that Scotsman, who is eating his own blood!” Bruce
heard what they said, and began to reflect that the blood upon
his hands might be indeed called his own, since it was that of his
brave countrymen who were fighting for the independence of
Scotland, whilst he was assisting its oppressors, who only laughed
at and mocked him for his unnatural conduct. He was so much
shocked and disgusted, that he arose from table, and, going into
a neighboring chapel, shed many tears, and asking pardon of
God for the great crime he had been guilty of, made a solemn
vow that he would atone for it, by doing all in his power to deliver
Scotland from the <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref494">foreign yoke</a>. Accordingly, he left, it is said,
the English army, and never joined it again, but remained watching
an opportunity for restoring the freedom of his country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this Robert the Bruce was a remarkably brave and
strong man; there was no man in Scotland that was thought a
match for him except Sir William Wallace; and now that Wallace
was dead, Bruce was held the best warrior in Scotland. He was
very wise and prudent, and an excellent general. He was generous,
too, and courteous by nature; but he had some faults, which
perhaps belonged as much to the fierce period in which he lived
as to his own character. He was rash and passionate, and in his
passion, he was sometimes relentless and cruel.</p>

<p>Robert the Bruce had fixed his purpose, as I told you, to
attempt once again to drive the English out of Scotland, and he
desired to prevail upon Sir John the Red Comyn, who was his
rival in his pretensions to the throne, to join with him in expelling
the foreign enemy by their common efforts. With this purpose,
Bruce posted <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref495">down from London</a> to Dumfries, on the borders
of Scotland, and requested an interview with John Comyn. They
met in the <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref496">church of the Minorites</a> in that town, before the high
altar. What passed betwixt them is not known with certainty;
but they quarreled, either concerning their <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref497">mutual pretensions</a>
to the crown, or because Comyn refused to join Bruce in the proposed
insurrection against the English; or, as many writers say,
because Bruce charged Comyn with having betrayed to the English
his purpose of rising up against King Edward. It is, however,
certain, that these two haughty barons came to high and abusive
words, until at length Bruce, who I told you was extremely passionate,
forgot the sacred character of the place in which they
stood, and struck Comyn a blow with his dagger. Having done
this rash deed, he instantly ran out of the church and called for
his horse. Two gentlemen of the country, Lindesay and Kirkpatrick,
friends of Bruce, were then in attendance on him. Seeing
him pale, and in much agitation, they eagerly inquired what was
the matter.</p>

<p>“I doubt,” said Bruce, “that I have slain the Red Comyn.”</p>

<p>“Do you leave such a matter in doubt?” said Kirkpatrick.
“I will make sicker!”—that is, I will make certain.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he and his companion Lindesay rushed into
the church, and made the matter certain with a vengeance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
by dispatching the wounded Comyn with their daggers. This
slaughter of Comyn was a most rash and cruel action; and the
historian of Bruce observes, that it was followed by the displeasure
of Heaven; for no man ever went through more misfortunes
than Robert Bruce, although he at length rose to great
honor.</p>

<p>The commencement of Bruce’s undertaking was most disastrous.
He was crowned on the twenty-ninth of March, 1306. On
the nineteenth of June, the new King was completely defeated near
Methven by the English Earl of Pembroke. Robert’s horse was
killed under him in the action, and he was for a moment a prisoner.
But he had fallen into the power of a Scottish knight, who,
though he served in the English army, did not choose to be the
instrument of putting Bruce into their hands, and allowed him to
escape.</p>

<p>Driven from one place in the Highlands to another, starved out
of some districts, and forced from others by the opposition of the
inhabitants, Bruce attempted to force his way into Lorn; but he
found enemies everywhere.</p>

<p>At last dangers increased so much around the brave King
Robert, that he was obliged to separate himself from his Queen
and her ladies; for the winter was coming on, and it would be
impossible for the women to endure this wandering sort of life
when the frost and snow should set in. So Bruce left his Queen,
with the Countess of Buchan and others, in the only castle which
remained to him, which was called Kildrummie, and is situated
near the head of the river Don in Aberdeenshire. The King also
left his youngest brother, Nigel Bruce, to defend the castle against
the English; and he himself, with his second brother Edward,
who was a very brave man, but still more rash and passionate
than Robert himself, went over to an island called Rachrin, on
the coast of Ireland, where Bruce and the few men who followed
his fortunes passed the winter of 1306.</p>

<p>The news of the taking of Kildrummie, the captivity of his
wife, and the execution of his brother, reached Bruce while he
was residing in a miserable dwelling at Rachrin, and reduced him
to the point of despair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about this time that an incident took place, which,
although it rests only on tradition in families of the name of
Bruce, is rendered probable by the manners of the times. After
receiving the last <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref498">unpleasing intelligence</a> from Scotland, Bruce
was lying one morning on his wretched bed, and deliberating with
himself whether he had not better resign all thoughts of again
attempting to make good his right to the Scottish crown, and, dismissing
his followers, transport himself and his brothers to the
Holy Land, and spend the rest of his life in fighting against the
Saracens; by which he thought, perhaps, he might deserve the
forgiveness of Heaven for the great sin of stabbing Comyn in the
church at Dumfries. But then, on the other hand, he thought it
would be both criminal and cowardly to give up his attempts to
restore freedom to Scotland while there yet remained the least
chance of his being successful in an undertaking, which, rightly
considered, was much more his duty than to drive the infidels
out of Palestine.</p>

<p>While he was divided betwixt these reflections, and doubtful
of what he should do, Bruce was looking upward to the roof of
the cabin in which he lay; and his eye was attracted by a spider,
which, hanging at the end of a long thread of its own spinning, was
endeavoring, as is the fashion of that creature, to swing itself
from one beam in the roof to another, for the purpose of fixing the
line on which it meant to stretch its web. The insect made the
attempt again and again without success; at length Bruce counted
that it had tried to carry its point six times, and been as often
unable to do so. It came into his head that he had himself fought
just six battles against the English and their allies, and that the
poor persevering spider was exactly in the same situation with
himself, having made as many trials and been as often disappointed
in what it aimed at. “Now,” thought Bruce, “as I have
no means of knowing what is best to be done, I will be guided by
the luck which shall attend this spider. If the insect shall make
another effort to fix its thread, and shall be successful, I will venture
a seventh time to try my fortune in Scotland; but if the spider
shall fail, I will go to the wars in Palestine, and never return to
my native country more.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>While Bruce was forming this resolution the spider made another
exertion with all the force it could muster, and fairly succeeded
in fastening its thread to the beam which it had so often
in vain attempted to reach. Bruce, seeing the success of the
spider, resolved to try his own fortune; and as he had never before
gained a victory, so he never afterwards sustained any considerable
or decisive check or defeat. I have often met with people
of the name of Bruce, so completely persuaded of the truth of this
story, that they would not on any account kill a spider, because
it was that insect which had shown the example of perseverance,
and given a signal of good luck to their great namesake.</p>

<p>Having determined to renew his efforts to obtain possession
of Scotland, notwithstanding the smallness of the means which
he had for accomplishing so great a purpose, the Bruce removed
himself and his followers from Rachrin to the island of Arran,
which lies in the mouth of the Clyde. The King landed and inquired
of the first woman he met what armed men were in the
island. She returned for answer that there had arrived there
very lately a body of armed strangers, who had defeated an English
officer, the governor of the castle of Brathwick, had killed
him and most of his men, and were now amusing themselves with
hunting about the island. The King, having caused himself to be
guided to the woods which these strangers most frequented, there
blew his horn repeatedly. Now, the chief of the strangers who
had taken the castle was James Douglas, one of the best of Bruce’s
friends, and he was accompanied by some of the bravest of that
patriotic band. When he heard Robert Bruce’s horn, he knew the
sound well, and cried out that yonder was the King; he knew by
his manner of blowing. So he and his companions hastened to
meet King Robert, and there was great joy on both sides; whilst
at the same time they could not help weeping when they considered
their own forlorn condition, and the great loss that had
taken place among their friends since they had last parted. But
they were <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref499">stout-hearted men</a>, and looked forward to freeing their
country in spite of all that had yet happened.</p>

<p>When King Edward the First heard that Scotland was again
in arms against him, he marched down to the borders with many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
threats of what he would do to avenge himself on Bruce and his
party, whom he called rebels.</p>

<p>Other great lords besides Douglas were now exerting themselves
to attack and destroy the English. Amongst those was Sir
Thomas Randolph, whose mother was a sister of King Robert.
He had joined with the Bruce when he first took up arms. Afterwards
being made prisoner by the English, when the King was
defeated at Methven, Sir Thomas Randolph was obliged to join
the English to save his life. He remained so constant to them,
that he was in company with Aymer de Valence and John of
Lorn, when they forced the Bruce to disperse his little band; and
he followed the pursuit so close, that he made his uncle’s standard-bearer
prisoner and took his banner. Afterwards, however, he
was himself made prisoner, at a solitary house on Lyne-water, by
the good Lord James Douglas, who brought him captive to the
King. Robert reproached his nephew for having deserted his
cause; and Randolph, who was very hot-tempered, answered insolently,
and was sent by King Robert to prison. Shortly after, the
uncle and nephew were reconciled, and Sir Thomas Randolph,
created Earl of Murray by the King, was ever afterwards one of
Bruce’s best supporters. There was a sort of rivalry between
Douglas and him, which should do the boldest and most hazardous
actions. I will just mention one or two circumstances, which will
show you what awful dangers were to be encountered by these
brave men, in order to free Scotland from its enemies and invaders.</p>

<p>While Robert Bruce was gradually getting possession of the
country, and driving out the English, Edinburgh, the principal
town of Scotland, remained, with its strong castle, in possession
of the invaders. Sir Thomas Randolph was extremely desirous
to gain this important place; but, as you well know, the castle is
situated on a very steep and lofty rock, so that it is difficult or
almost impossible even to get up to the foot of the walls, much
more to climb over them.</p>

<p>So while Randolph was considering what was to be done, there
came to him a Scottish gentleman named Francis, who had joined
Bruce’s standard, and asked to speak with him in private. He
then told Randolph, that in his youth he had lived in the Castle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of Edinburgh, and that his father had then been keeper of the
fortress. It happened at that time that Francis was much in
love with a lady, who lived in a part of the town beneath the
castle, which is called the Grassmarket. Now, as he could not
get out of the castle by day to see her, he had practiced a way
of clambering by night down the castle rock on the south side,
and returning at his pleasure; when he came to the foot of the
wall, he made use of a ladder to get over it, as it was not very
high at that point, those who built it having trusted to the steepness
of the crag; and, for the same reason, no watch was placed
there. Francis had gone and come so frequently in this dangerous
manner, that, though it was now long ago, he told Randolph
he knew the road so well that he would undertake to guide a small
party of men by night to the bottom of the wall; and as they might
bring ladders with them, there would be no difficulty in scaling it.
The great risk was that of their being discovered by the watchmen
while in the act of ascending the cliff, in which case every
man of them must have perished.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Randolph did not hesitate to attempt the adventure.
He took with him only thirty men (you may be sure they
were chosen for activity and courage), and came one dark night
to the foot of the rock, which they began to ascend under the
guidance of Francis, who went before them, upon his hands and
feet, up one cliff, down another, and round another, where there
was scarce room to support themselves. All the while these
thirty men were obliged to follow in a line, one after the other,
by a path that was fitter for a cat than a man. The noise of a
stone falling, or a word spoken from one to another, would have
alarmed the watchmen. They were obliged, therefore, to move
with the greatest precaution. When they were far up the crag,
and near the foundation of the wall, they heard the guards going
their rounds, to see that all was safe in and about the castle.
Randolph and his party had nothing for it but to lie close and
quiet, each man under the crag, as he happened to be placed, and
trust that the guards would pass by without noticing them. And
while they were waiting in breathless alarm they got a new cause
of fright. One of the soldiers of the castle, willing to startle his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
comrades, suddenly threw a stone from the wall, and cried out,
“Aha, I see you well!” The stone came thundering down over the
heads of Randolph and his men, who naturally thought themselves
discovered. If they had stirred, or made the slightest noise,
they would have been entirely destroyed; for the soldiers above
might have killed every man of them merely by rolling down
stones. But being courageous and chosen men, they remained
quiet, and the English soldiers, who thought their comrade was
merely playing them a trick (as, indeed, he had no other meaning
in what he did and said), passed on without further examination.</p>

<p>Then Randolph and his men got up and came in haste to the
foot of the wall, which was not above twice a man’s height in that
place. They planted the ladders they had brought, and Francis
mounted first to show them the way; Sir Andrew Grey, a brave
knight, followed him, and Randolph himself was the third man
who got over. Then the rest followed. When once they were
within the walls, there was not so much to do, for the garrison
were asleep and unarmed, excepting the watch, who were speedily
destroyed. Thus was Edinburgh Castle taken in March, 1312-13.</p>

<p>It was not, however, only by the exertions of great and powerful
barons, like Randolph and Douglas, that the freedom of Scotland
was to be accomplished. The <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref500">stout yeomanry</a> and the <a href="#phrases44" title="List of phrases" id="ref501">bold
peasantry</a> of the land, who were as desirous to enjoy their cottages
in honorable independence as the nobles were to reclaim
their castles and estates from the English, contributed their full
share in the efforts which were made to deliver the country from
the invaders. I will give you one instance among many.</p>

<p>There was a strong castle near Linlithgow, or Lithgow, as the
word is more generally pronounced, where an English governor,
with a powerful garrison, lay in readiness to support the English
cause, and used to exercise much severity upon the Scots in the
neighborhood. There lived at no great distance from this stronghold,
a farmer, a bold and stout man, whose name was Binnock,
or, as it is now pronounced, Binning. This man saw with great
joy the progress which the Scots were making in recovering their
country from the English, and resolved to do something to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
his countrymen, by getting possession, if it were possible, of the
Castle of Lithgow. But the place was very strong, situated by
the side of a lake, defended not only by gates, which were usually
kept shut against strangers, but also by a portcullis. A portcullis
is a sort of door formed of cross-bars of iron, like a grate. It has
not hinges like a door, but is drawn up by pulleys, and let down
when any danger approaches. It may be let go in a moment, and
then falls down into the doorway; and as it has great iron spikes
at the bottom, it crushes all that it lights upon; thus in case of a
sudden alarm, a portcullis may be let suddenly fall to defend the
entrance, when it is not possible to shut the gates. Binnock knew
this very well, but he resolved to be provided against this risk
also when he attempted to surprise the castle. So he spoke with
some bold, courageous countrymen, and engaged them in his enterprise,
which he accomplished thus:</p>

<p>Binnock had been accustomed to supply the garrison of Linlithgow
with hay, and he had been ordered by the English governor
to furnish some cart-loads, of which they were in want. He
promised to bring it accordingly; but the night before he drove the
hay to the castle, he stationed a party of his friends, as well armed
as possible, near the entrance, where they could not be seen by the
garrison, and gave them directions that they should come to his
assistance as soon as they should hear him cry a signal, which
was to be, “Call all, call all!” Then he loaded a great wagon with
hay. But in the wagon he placed eight strong men, well armed,
lying flat on their breasts, and covered over with hay, so that they
could not be seen. He himself walked carelessly beside the wagon;
and he chose the stoutest and bravest of his servants to be the
driver, who carried at his belt a strong ax or hatchet. In this way
Binnock approached the castle early in the morning; and the
watchman, who only saw two men, Binnock being one of them,
with a cart of hay, which they expected, opened the gates and
raised up the portcullis, to permit them to enter the castle. But
as soon as the cart had gotten under the gateway, Binnock made
a sign to his servant, who with his ax suddenly cut asunder the
<em>soam</em>, that is, the yoke which fastens the horses to the cart, and
the horses finding themselves free, naturally started forward, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
cart remaining behind. At the same moment, Binnock cried, as
loud as he could, “Call all, call all!” and drawing the sword, which
he had under his country habit, he killed the porter. The armed
men then jumped up from under the hay where they lay concealed,
and rushed on the English guard. The Englishmen tried
to shut the gates, but they could not, because the cart of hay
remained in the gateway, and prevented the folding-doors from
being closed. The portcullis was also let fall, but the grating was
caught on the cart, and so could not drop to the ground. The
men who were in ambush near the gate, hearing the cry, “Call all,
call all,” ran to assist those who had leaped out from amongst
the hay; the castle was taken, and all the Englishmen killed or
made prisoners. King Robert rewarded Binnock by bestowing
on him an estate, which his posterity long afterwards enjoyed.</p>

<p>The English now possessed scarcely any place of importance
in Scotland, excepting Stirling, which was besieged, or rather
blockaded, by Edward Bruce, the King’s brother. To blockade a
town or castle is to quarter an army around it, so as to prevent
those within from getting provisions. This was done by the Scots
before Stirling, till Sir Philip Mowbray, who commanded the
castle, finding that he was like to be reduced to extremity for want
of provisions, made an agreement with Edward Bruce that he
would surrender the place, provided he were not relieved by the
King of England before midsummer. Sir Edward agreed to these
terms, and allowed Mowbray to go to London, to tell King Edward
of the conditions he had made. But when King Robert heard what
his brother had done, he thought it was too great a risk, since it
obliged him to venture a battle with the full strength of Edward
the Second, who had under him England, Ireland, Wales, and great
part of France, and could within the time allowed assemble a
much more powerful army than the Scots could, even if all Scotland
were fully under the King’s authority. Sir Edward answered
his brother with his naturally audacious spirit, “Let Edward bring
every man he has, we will fight them, were they more.” The King
admired his courage, though it was mingled with rashness. “Since
it is so, brother,” he said, “we will manfully abide battle, and
assemble all who love us, and value the freedom of Scotland, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
come with all the men they have, and help us to oppose King
Edward, should he come with his army, to rescue Stirling.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Battle of Bannockburn (1314)</span></h5>

<p>When Sir Philip Mowbray, the governor of Stirling, came to
London, to tell the King that Stirling, the last Scottish town of
importance which remained in possession of the English, was to be
surrendered if it were not relieved by force of arms before midsummer,
then all the English nobles called out, it would be a sin
and shame to permit the <a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref502">fair conquest</a> which Edward the First
had made, to be forfeited to the Scots for want of fighting.</p>

<p>King Edward the Second, therefore, assembled one of the
greatest armies which a King of England ever commanded. There
were troops brought from all his dominions. Many brave soldiers
from the French provinces which the King of England possessed
in France—many Irish, many Welsh—and all the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
English nobles and barons, with their followers, were assembled in
one great army. The number was not less than one hundred
thousand men.</p>

<p>King Robert the Bruce summoned all his nobles and barons to
join him, when he heard of the great preparations which the King
of England was making. They were not so numerous as the English
by many thousand men. In fact, his whole army did not very
much exceed thirty thousand, and they were much worse
armed than the wealthy Englishmen; but then, Robert, who was
at their head, was one of the most expert generals of the time;
and the officers he had under him were his brother Edward, his
nephew Randolph, his faithful follower the Douglas, and other
brave and experienced leaders, who commanded the same men
that had been accustomed to fight and gain victories under every
<a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref503">disadvantage of situation</a> and numbers.</p>

<p>The King, on his part, studied how he might supply, by address
and stratagem, what he wanted in numbers and strength. He
knew the superiority of the English, both in their heavy-armed
cavalry, which were much better mounted and armed than that
of the Scots, and in their archers, who were better trained than
any others in the world. Both these advantages he resolved to
provide against. With this purpose, he led his army down into a
plain near Stirling, called the Park, near which, and beneath it,
the English army must needs pass through a boggy country,
broken with water-courses, while the Scots occupied hard dry
ground. He then caused all the ground upon the front of his line
of battle, where cavalry were likely to act, to be dug full of holes,
about as deep as a man’s knee. They were filled with light brushwood,
and the turf was laid on the top, so that it appeared a plain
field, while in reality it was all full of these pits as a honeycomb
is of holes. He also, it is said, caused steel spikes, called calthrops,
to be scattered up and down in the plain, where the English cavalry
were most likely to advance, trusting in that manner to lame
and destroy their horses.</p>

<p>When the Scottish army was drawn up, the line stretched
north and south. On the south, it was terminated by the banks
of the brook, called Bannockburn, which are so rocky, that no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
troops could attack them there. On the left, the Scottish line
extended near to the town of Stirling. Bruce reviewed his troops
very carefully; all the useless servants, drivers of carts, and such
like, of whom there were very many, he ordered to go behind a
height, afterwards, in memory of the event, called the Gillies’
hill, that is, the Servants’ hill. He then spoke to the soldiers, and
expressed his determination to gain the victory, or to lose his life
on the field of battle. He desired that all those who did not propose
to fight to the last should leave the field before the battle
began, and that none should remain except those who were determined
to take the issue of victory or death, as God should send it.</p>

<p>When the main body of his army was thus placed in order, the
King posted Randolph, with a body of horse, near to the Church
of St. Ninian’s, commanding him to use the utmost diligence to
prevent any succors from being thrown into Stirling Castle. He
then dispatched James of Douglas, and Sir Robert Keith, the
Mareschal of the Scottish army, in order that they might survey
as nearly as they could, the English force, which was now approaching
from Falkirk. They returned with information, that
the approach of that vast host was one of the most beautiful and
terrible sights which could be seen—that the whole country
seemed covered with men-at-arms on horse and foot—that the
number of standards, banners, and pennons made so gallant a
show, that the bravest and most numerous host in Christendom
might be alarmed to see King Edward moving against them.</p>

<p>It was upon the twenty-third of June (1314) the King of
Scotland heard the news, that the English army were approaching
Stirling. He drew out his army, therefore, in the order which he
had before resolved on. After a short time, Bruce, who was looking
out anxiously for the enemy, saw a body of English cavalry
trying to get into Stirling from the eastward. This was the Lord
Clifford, who, with a chosen body of eight hundred horse, had
been detached to relieve the castle.</p>

<p>“See, Randolph,” said the King to his nephew, “there is a rose
fallen from your chaplet.” By this he meant that Randolph had
lost some honor, by suffering the enemy to pass where he had been
stationed to hinder them. Randolph made no reply but rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
against Clifford with little more than half his number. The Scots
were on foot. The English turned to charge them with their
lances, and Randolph drew up his men in close order to receive
the onset. He seemed to be in so much danger, that Douglas
asked leave of the King to go and assist him. The King refused
him permission.</p>

<p>“Let Randolph,” he said, “redeem his own fault; I cannot
break the order of battle for his sake.” Still the danger appeared
greater, and the English horse seemed entirely to encompass the
small handful of Scottish infantry. “So please you,” said Douglas
to the king, “my heart will not suffer me to stand idle and see
Randolph perish—I must go to his assistance.” He rode off
accordingly; but long before they had reached the place of combat,
they saw the English horses galloping off, many with empty
saddles.</p>

<p>“Halt!” said Douglas to his men, “Randolph has gained the
day; since we were not soon enough to help him in the battle, do
not let us lessen his glory by approaching the field.” Now, that
was nobly done; especially as Douglas and Randolph were always
contending which should rise highest in the good opinion of
the King of the nation.</p>

<p>The van of the English army now came in sight, and a number
of their bravest knights drew near to see what the Scots were
doing. They saw King Robert dressed in his armor and distinguished
by a gold crown, which he wore over his helmet. He was
not mounted on his great war-horse, because he did not expect to
fight that evening. But he rode on a little pony up and down
the ranks of his army, putting his men in order, and carried in his
hand a sort of battle-ax made of steel.</p>

<p>The next morning, being the twenty-fourth of June, at break
of day, the battle began in terrible earnest. The English as they
advanced saw the Scots getting into line. The Abbot of Inchaffray
walked through their ranks bare-footed, and exhorted them
to fight for their freedom. They kneeled down as he passed, and
prayed to Heaven for victory. King Edward, who saw this, called
out, “They kneel down—they are asking forgiveness.” “Yes,”
said a celebrated English baron, called Ingelram de Umphraville,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
“but they ask it from God, not from us—these men will conquer,
or die upon the field.”</p>

<p>The English King ordered his men to begin the battle. The
archers then bent their bows, and began to shoot so closely together,
that the arrows fell like flakes of snow on a Christmas
day. They killed many of the Scots, and might, as at Falkirk,
and other places, have decided the victory; but Bruce, as I told
you before, was prepared for them. He had in readiness a body
of men-at-arms, well mounted, who rode at full gallop among the
archers, and as they had no weapons save their bows and arrows,
which they could not use when they were attacked hand to hand,
they were cut down in great numbers by the Scottish horsemen,
and thrown into total confusion.</p>

<p>The fine English cavalry then advanced to support their archers,
and to attack the Scottish line. But coming over the ground
which was dug full of pits, the horses fell into these holes, and
the riders lay tumbling about, without any means of defense,
and unable to rise, from the weight of their armor. The Englishmen
began to fall into general disorder; and the Scottish King,
bringing up more of his forces, attacked and pressed them still
more closely.</p>

<p>On a sudden, while the battle <a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref504">was obstinately maintained</a> on
both sides, an event happened which decided the victory. The
servants and attendants on the Scottish camp had, as I told you,
been sent behind the army to a place afterwards called the Gillies’
hill. But when they saw that their masters were likely to gain
the day, they rushed from their place of concealment with such
weapons as they could get, that they might have their share in the
victory and in the spoil. The English, seeing them come suddenly
over the hill, mistook this <a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref505">disorderly rabble</a> for a new army coming
up to sustain the Scots, and, losing all heart, began to shift
every man for himself. Edward himself left the field as fast as he
could ride. A <a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref506">valiant knight</a>, Sir Giles de Argentine, much renowned
in the wars of Palestine, attended the King till he got him
out of the press of the combat. But he would retreat no farther.
“It is not my custom,” he said, “to fly.” With that he took leave
of the King, set spurs to his horse, and calling out his war-cry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
Argentine! Argentine! he rushed into the thickest of the Scottish
ranks, and was killed.</p>

<p>Edward first fled to Stirling Castle, and <a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref507">entreated admittance</a>;
but Sir Philip Mowbray, the governor, reminded the <a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref508">fugitive sovereign</a>
that he was obliged to surrender the castle next day, so
Edward was fain to fly through the Torwood, closely pursued by
Douglas with a body of cavalry.</p>

<p>Douglas and Abernethy continued the chase, not giving King
Edward time to alight from horseback even for an instant, and
followed him as far as Dunbar, where the English had still a
friend, in the governor, Patrick, Earl of March. The Earl received
Edward in his forlorn condition, and furnished him with a fishing
skiff, or small ship, in which he escaped to England, having entirely
lost his fine army, and a great number of his bravest nobles.</p>

<p>The English never before or afterwards, whether in France or
Scotland, lost so dreadful a battle as that of Bannockburn, nor
did the Scots ever gain one of the same importance. Many of the
best and bravest of the English nobility and gentry, as I have said,
lay dead on the field; a great many more were made prisoners; and
the whole of King Edward’s immense army was dispersed or
destroyed.</p>

<p>The English, after this great defeat, were no longer in a condition
to support their pretensions to be masters of Scotland, or
to continue, as they had done for nearly twenty years, to send
armies into that country to overcome it. On the contrary, they
became for a time scarce able to defend their own frontiers against
King Robert and his soldiers.</p>

<p>Thus did Robert Bruce arise from the condition of an exile,
hunted with bloodhounds like a stag or beast of prey, to the rank
of an independent sovereign, universally acknowledged to be one
of the wisest and bravest kings who then lived. The nation of
Scotland was also raised once more from the situation of a distressed
and conquered province to that of a free and independent
state, governed by its own laws, and subject to its own princes;
and although the country was, after the Bruce’s death, often subjected
to great loss and distress, both by the hostility of the English,
and by the unhappy <a href="#phrases45" title="List of phrases" id="ref509">civil wars</a> among the Scots themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
yet they never afterwards lost the freedom for which Wallace
had laid down his life, and which King Robert had recovered, not
less by his wisdom than by his weapons. And therefore most just
it is, that while the country of Scotland retains any recollection
of its history, the memory of those brave warriors and faithful
patriots should be remembered with honor and gratitude.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Exploits of Douglas and Randolph (1315-1330)</span></h5>

<p>Robert Bruce continued to reign gloriously for several years,
and was so constantly victorious over the English, that the Scots
seemed during his government to have acquired a complete superiority
over their neighbors. But then we must remember that
Edward the Second, who then reigned in England, was a foolish
prince, and listened to bad counsels; so that it is no wonder that
he was beaten by so wise and experienced a general as Robert
Bruce, who had fought his way to the crown through so many
disasters, and <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref510">acquired in consequence</a> so much renown, that, as
I have often said, he was generally accounted one of the best soldiers
and wisest sovereigns of his time.</p>

<p>In the last year of Robert the Bruce’s reign, he became extremely
sickly and infirm, chiefly owing to a disorder called the
leprosy, which he had caught during the hardships and misfortunes
of his youth, when he was so frequently obliged to hide himself
in woods and morasses, without a roof to shelter him. While
Bruce was in this feeble state, Edward the Second, King of England,
died, and was succeeded by his son Edward the Third. He
turned out afterwards to be one of the wisest and bravest kings
whom England ever had; but when he first mounted the throne
he was very young, and under the entire management of his
mother.</p>

<p>The war between the English and the Scots still lasting at the
time, Bruce sent his two great commanders, the good Lord James
Douglas, and Thomas Randolph, Earl of Murray, to <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref511">lay waste</a> the
counties of Northumberland and Durham, and distress the English
as much as they could.</p>

<p>Their soldiers were about twenty thousand in number, all
lightly armed, and mounted on horses that were quite small in
height, but excessively active. The men themselves carried no
provision, except a bag of oatmeal; and each had at his saddle
a small plate of iron called a girdle, on which, when they pleased,
they could bake the oatmeal into cakes. They killed the cattle
of the English, as they traveled through the country, roasted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
flesh on <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref512">wooden spits</a>, or boiled it in the skins of the animals themselves,
putting in a little water with the beef, to prevent the fire
from burning the hide to pieces. This was rough cookery. They
made their shoes, or rather sandals, in as coarse a way; cutting
them out of the raw hides of the cattle, and fitting them to their
ankles, like what are now called short gaiters. As this sort of
buskin had the hairy side of the hide outermost, the English called
those who wore them <em>rough-footed</em> Scots, and sometimes, from
the color of the hide, <em>red-shanks</em>.</p>

<p>As such forces needed to carry nothing with them, either for
provisions or ammunition, the Scots moved with amazing speed,
from mountain to mountain, and from glen to glen, pillaging and
destroying the country wheresoever they came. In the meanwhile,
the King of England pursued them with a much larger army; but,
as it was encumbered by the necessity of carrying provisions in
great quantities, and by the slow motions of men in heavy armor,
they could not come up with the Scots, although they saw every
day the smoke of the houses and villages which they were burning.
The King of England was extremely angry; for, though only a
boy sixteen years old, he longed to fight the Scots and to chastise
them for the mischief they were doing to his country; and at
length he grew so impatient that he offered a large reward to any
one who would show him where the Scottish army were.</p>

<p>At length, after the English host had suffered severe hardships,
from want of provisions, and fatiguing journeys through fords,
and swamps, and morasses, a gentleman named Rokeby came into
the camp and claimed the reward which the King had offered.
He told the King that he had been made prisoner by the Scots,
and that they said they should be as glad to meet the English
King as he to see them. Accordingly, Rokeby guided the English
army to the place where the Scots lay encamped.</p>

<p>But the English King was no nearer to the battle which he
desired; for Douglas and Randolph, knowing the force and numbers
of the English army, had taken up their camp on a steep hill,
at the bottom of which ran a deep river called the Wear, having
a channel filled with large stones, so that there was no possibility
for the English to attack the Scots without crossing the water, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
then climbing up the steep hill in the very face of their enemy;
a risk which was too great to be attempted.</p>

<p>Then the King sent a message of defiance to the Scottish generals,
inviting them either to draw back their forces, and allow
him freedom to cross the river and time to place his army in order
of battle on the other side, that they might fight fairly, or offering,
if they liked it better, to permit them to cross over to his side
without opposition, that they might join battle on a fair field.
Randolph and Douglas did nothing but laugh at this message.
They said that when they fought, it should be at their own pleasure,
and not because the King of England chose to ask for a battle.
They reminded him, insultingly, how they had been in his country
for many days, burning, taking spoil, and doing what they thought
fit. If the King was displeased with this, they said he must find
his way across the river to fight them, the best way he could.</p>

<p>The English King, determined not to quit sight of the Scots,
encamped on the opposite side of the river to watch their motions,
thinking that want of provisions would oblige them to quit their
strong position on the mountains. But the Scots once more showed
Edward their <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref513">dexterity in marching</a>, by leaving their encampment,
and taking up another post, even stronger and more difficult
to approach than the first which they had occupied. King Edward
followed, and again encamped opposite to his dexterous and
troublesome enemies, desirous to bring them to a battle, when he
might hope to gain an easy victory, having more than double the
number of the Scottish army, all troops of the very best quality.</p>

<p>While the armies lay thus opposed to each other, Douglas
resolved to give the young King of England a lesson in the art of
war. At the dead of night, he left the Scottish camp with a small
body of chosen horse, not above two hundred, well armed. He
crossed the river in deep silence and came to the English camp,
which was but carelessly guarded. Seeing this, Douglas rode past
the English sentinels as if he had been an officer of the English
army, saying—“Ha, <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref514">Saint George</a>! you keep bad watch here.”
In those days, you must know, the English used to swear by Saint
George, as the Scots did by <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref515">Saint Andrew</a>. Presently after, Douglas
heard an English soldier, who lay stretched by the fire, say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
his comrade, “I cannot tell what is to happen to us in this place;
but, for my part, I have a great fear of the Black Douglas playing
us some trick.”</p>

<p>“You shall have cause to say so,” said Douglas to himself.</p>

<p>When he had thus got into the midst of the English camp
without being discovered, he drew his sword, and cut asunder the
ropes of a tent, calling out his usual war-cry, “Douglas, Douglas!
English thieves, you are all dead men.” His followers immediately
began to cut down and overturn the tents, cutting and
stabbing the English soldiers as they endeavored to get to
arms.</p>

<p>Douglas forced his way to the <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref516">pavilion of the King</a> himself,
and very nearly carried the young prince prisoner out of the
middle of his great army. Edward’s chaplain, however, and many
of his household, stood to arms bravely in his defense, while the
young King escaped by creeping away beneath the canvas of his
tent. The chaplain and several of the King’s officers were slain;
but the whole camp was now alarmed and in arms, so that Douglas
was obliged to retreat, which he did by bursting through the English
at the side of the camp opposite to that by which he had
entered. Being separated from his men in the confusion, he was
in great danger of being slain by an Englishman who encountered
him with a huge club. This man he killed, but with considerable
difficulty; and then blowing his horn to collect his soldiers, who
soon gathered around him, he returned to the Scottish camp, having
sustained very little loss.</p>

<p>Edward, much mortified at the insult which he had received,
became still more desirous of chastising those <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref517">audacious adversaries</a>;
and one of them at least was not unwilling to afford him
an opportunity of revenge. This was Thomas Randolph, Earl of
Murray. He asked Douglas, when he returned to the Scottish
camp, what he had done. “We have drawn some blood.”—“Ah,”
said the Earl, “had we gone all together to the night attack,
we should have discomfited them.”—“It might well have been
so,” said Douglas, “but the risk would have been too great.”—“Then
will we fight them in open battle,” said Randolph, “for if
we remain here, we shall in time be famished for want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
provisions.”—“Not so,” replied Douglas; “we will deal with this
great army of the English as the fox did with the fisherman in
the fable.”—“And how was that?” said the Earl of Murray.
Hereupon the Douglas told him this story:</p>

<p>“A fisherman,” he said, “had made a hut by a river side, that
he might follow his occupation of fishing. Now, one night he
had gone out to look after his nets, leaving a small fire in his hut;
and when he came back, behold there was a fox in the cabin,
taking the liberty to eat one of the finest salmon he had taken.
‘Ho, Mr. Robber!’ said the fisherman, drawing his sword, and
standing in the doorway to prevent the fox’s escape, ‘you shall
presently die the death.’ The poor fox looked for some hole to
get out at, but saw none; whereupon he pulled down with his
teeth a mantle, which was lying on the bed, and dragged it across
the fire. The fisherman ran to snatch his mantle from the fire—the
fox flew out at the door with the salmon; and so,” said Douglas,
“shall we escape the great English army by subtlety, and
without risking battle with so large a force.”</p>

<p>Randolph agreed to act by Douglas’s counsel, and the Scottish
army kindled great fires through their encampment, and made a
noise and shouting, and blowing of horns, as if they meant to
remain all night there, as before. But in the meantime, Douglas
had caused a road to be made through two miles of a great morass
which lay in their rear. This was done by cutting down to the
bottom of the bog, and filling the trench with faggots of wood.
Without this contrivance it would have been impossible that the
army could have crossed; and through this passage, which the
English never suspected, Douglas and Randolph, and all their
men, moved at the dead of night. They did not leave so much
as an errand-boy behind, and so bent their march toward Scotland,
leaving the English disappointed and affronted. Great was
their wonder in the morning, when they saw the Scottish camp
empty, and found no living man in it, but two or three English
prisoners tied to trees, whom they had left with an insulting message
to the King of England, saying that if he were displeased with
what they had done, he might come and revenge himself in
Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>After this a peace was concluded with Robert Bruce, on terms
highly honorable to Scotland; for the English King <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref518">renounced all
pretensions</a> to the sovereignty of the country, and, moreover, gave
his sister, a princess called Joanna, to be wife to Robert Bruce’s
son, called David. This treaty was very advantageous to the
Scots. It was called the treaty of Northampton, because it was
concluded at that town, in the year 1328.</p>

<p>Good King Robert did not long survive this joyful event. He
was not aged more than four-and-fifty years, but, as I said before,
his bad health was caused by the hardships which he sustained
during his youth, and at length he became very ill. Finding that
he could not recover, he assembled around his bedside the nobles
and counselors in whom he most trusted. He told them that
now, being on his death-bed, he sorely repented all his misdeeds,
and particularly, that he had, in his passion, killed Comyn with
his own hand, in the church and before the altar. He said that
if he had lived, he had intended to go to Jerusalem, to make war
upon the Saracens who held the Holy Land, as some expiation
for the evil deeds he had done. The King soon afterwards expired
and his body was laid in the sepulcher in the midst of the
church of Dunfermline, under a marble stone. But the church
becoming afterwards ruinous, and the roof falling down with age,
the monument was broken to pieces, and nobody could tell where
it stood. But six or seven years ago, when they were repairing
the church at Dunfermline, and removing the rubbish, lo! they
found fragments of the marble tomb of Robert Bruce. Then they
began to dig farther, thinking to discover the body of this celebrated
monarch; and at length they came to the skeleton of a tall
man, and they knew it must be that of King Robert, as he was
known to have been buried in a winding sheet of cloth of gold,
of which many fragments were found about this skeleton. So
orders were sent from the <a href="#phrases46" title="List of phrases" id="ref519">King’s Court of Exchequer</a> to guard
the bones carefully, until a new tomb should be prepared, into
which they were laid with profound respect. A great many gentlemen
and ladies attended, and almost all the common people
in the neighborhood; and as the church could not hold half the
numbers, the people were allowed to pass through it, one after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
another, that each one, the poorest as well as the richest, might
see all that remained of the great King, Robert Bruce, who
restored the Scottish monarchy.</p>

<p>It is more than five hundred years since the body of Bruce
was first laid into the tomb; and how many, many millions of
men have died since that time. It was a great thing to see that
the wisdom, courage, and patriotism of a King could preserve
him for such a long time in the memory of the people over whom
he once reigned. But then, my dear child, you must remember
that it is only desirable to be remembered for praiseworthy and
patriotic actions, such as those of Robert Bruce. It would be
better for a prince to be forgotten like the meanest peasant than
to be recollected for actions of tyranny or oppression.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Note.</b> Marmion, an English nobleman, has been sent as an envoy
by Henry the Eighth, King of England, to James the Fourth, King of Scotland.
The two countries are on the eve of war with each other. Arriving
in Edinburgh, Marmion is entrusted by King James to the care and hospitality
of Douglas, Earl of Angus, who, taking him to his castle at Tantallon,
treats him with the respect due his position as representative of the
King, but at the same time dislikes him. The war approaching, Marmion
leaves to join the English camp. This sketch describes the leave-taking.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. In what part of the castle does this conversation take
place? 2. Why did Douglas refuse to receive the hand of Marmion? 3.
Read the lines that give a vivid picture of the defiant Douglas. 4. What
distinction does Douglas make between the ownership of his “castle” and
that of his “hand”? 5. How does Marmion answer the implied insult in
“howe’er unmeet to be the owner’s peer”? 6. What claim does Marmion
make for one “who does England’s message”? 7. What do we call one “who
does England’s message” at Washington? 8. What does Douglas mean by
“to beard the lion in his den”? 9. What lines show Marmion’s narrow
escape? 10. Why do you think Douglas changed his mind? 11. Would you
have admired him more if he had given chase to Marmion? 12. Which
man appears to better advantage in this scene?</p>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> Burns wrote this ode to fit an old air, said in Scottish
tradition to have been Robert Bruce’s march at the battle of Bannockburn.
“This thought,” he says, “in my solitary wanderings, has warmed me to a
pitch of enthusiasm on the theme of liberty and independence.” The story
is told that Burns wrote this poem while riding on horseback over a wild
moor in Scotland in company with a Mr. Syme, who, observing the expression
on the poet’s face, refrained from speaking to him. Doubtless this
vigorous hymn was singing itself through the soul of Burns as he wrote it.
The poem is considered the most stirring war ode ever written.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Who is supposed to speak the words? 2. To whom are
they supposed to be addressed? 3. For what did Bruce contend? 4. What
patriot before him had fought against great odds in the same cause? 5. In
these lines, what choice does Bruce offer his army? 6. To what deep feeling
does he appeal? 7. Does this poem represent truly Bruce’s own feeling for
his country, as history acquaints us with it? 8. Which are the most stirring
lines? 9. What was Burns’s purpose in writing it? 10. What influence does
such a poem have?</p>

<h4>THE LAST FIGHT OF THE REVENGE</h4>

<p class="author">SIR WALTER RALEIGH</p>

<p>The Lord Thomas Howard, with six of her Majesty’s ships, six
victuallers of London, the bark <i>Raleigh</i>, and two or three pinnaces,
riding at anchor near unto Flores, one of the westerly
islands of the Azores, the last of August in the afternoon, had
intelligence by one Captain Middleton of the approach of the
Spanish Armada.</p>

<p>He had no sooner delivered the news but the fleet was in sight.
Many of our ships’ companies were on shore in the island, some
<a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref530">providing ballast</a> for their ships, others filling of water and refreshing
themselves from the land with such things as they could
either for money or by force recover. By reason whereof our
ships being all pestered and every thing out of order, very light
for want of ballast, and that which was most to our disadvantage,
the one half of the men of every ship sick and utterly unserviceable.
For in the <i>Revenge</i> there were ninety diseased; in the
<i>Bonaventure</i>, not so many in health as could handle her mainsail;
the rest, for the most part, were in little better state.</p>

<p>The names of her Majesty’s ships were these, as followeth:
the <i>Defiance</i>, which was Admiral, the <i>Revenge</i>, Vice Admiral,
the <i>Bonaventure</i>, commanded by Captain Crosse, the <i>Lion</i>, by
George Fenner, the <i>Foresight</i>, by Thomas Vavisour, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
<i>Crane</i>, by Duffield; the <i>Foresight</i> and the <i>Crane</i> being but small
ships only—the others were of middle size. The rest, besides the
bark <i>Raleigh</i>, commanded by Captain Thin, were victuallers, and
of small force or none.</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet, having <a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref531">shrouded their approach</a> by reason
of the island, were now so soon at hand as our ships had scarce
time to <a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref532">weigh their anchors</a>, but some of them were driven to let
slip their cables and set sail. Sir Richard Grenville was the last
weighed, to recover the men that were upon the island, which
otherwise had been lost. The Lord Thomas with the rest very
hardly recovered the wind, which Sir Richard Grenville not being
able to do, was persuaded by the master and others to cut his
mainsail and cast about, and to trust to the sailing of his ship.
But Sir Richard utterly refused to turn from the enemy, alleging
that he would rather choose to die than to dishonor himself, his
country, and her Majesty’s ship, persuading his company that he
would pass through the two squadrons in despite of them and
enforce those of Seville to give him way. Which he performed
upon divers of the foremost, who, as the mariners term it, fell
under the lee of the <i>Revenge</i>.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, as he attended those which were nearest him,
the great <i>San Philip</i>, being in the wind of him, and coming toward
him, becalmed his sails—so huge was the Spanish ship, being of a
thousand and five hundred tons; who afterlaid the <i>Revenge</i>
aboard. When he was thus bereft of his sails, the ships that were
under his lee also laid him aboard; of which the next was the
admiral of the Biscayans, a very mighty and <a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref533">puissant ship</a> commanded
by Brittan Dona. The said <i>Philip</i> carried three tier of
ordnance on a side and eleven pieces in every tier.</p>

<p>After the <i>Revenge</i> was entangled with this <i>Philip</i>, four others
boarded her, two on her larboard and two on her starboard. The
fight thus beginning at three of the clock in the afternoon continued
very terrible all that evening. But the great <i>San Philip</i>,
having received the lower tier of the <i>Revenge</i>, shifted herself with
all diligence from her sides, utterly misliking her first entertainment.
Some say that the ship foundered, but we cannot report
it for truth unless we were assured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>The Spanish ships were filled with companies of soldiers, in
some two hundred besides the mariners, in some five, in others
eight hundred. In ours there were none at all besides the mariners
but the servants of the commanders and some few voluntary
gentlemen only.</p>

<p>After many interchanged volleys of great ordnance and small
shot, the Spaniards deliberated to enter the <i>Revenge</i>, and made
divers attempts, hoping to force her by the multitudes of their
armed soldiers and musketeers, but were still repulsed again and
again, and at all times beaten back into their own ships or into
the seas. In the beginning of the fight, the <i>George Noble</i> of
London, having received some shot through her by the armados,
asked Sir Richard what he would command him, being but one of
the victuallers and of small force. Sir Richard bade him save
himself, and leave him to his fortune.</p>

<p>After the fight had thus without intermission continued while
the day lasted and some hours of the night, many of our men were
slain and hurt, and one of the great galleons of the Armada and
the admiral of the Hulks both sunk, and in many other of the
Spanish ships great slaughter was made. Some write that Sir
Richard was very dangerously hurt almost in the beginning of
the fight and lay speechless for a time ere he recovered. But
two of the <i>Revenge’s</i> own company affirmed that he was never so
wounded as that he forsook the upper deck till an hour before
midnight; and then being shot into the body with a musket, as he
was a-dressing was again shot into the head, and withal his
chirurgeon wounded to death.</p>

<p>But to return to the fight, the Spanish ships which attempted
to board the <i>Revenge</i>, as they were wounded and beaten off, so
always others came in their places, she having never less than
two mighty galleons by her sides and aboard her. So that ere
the morning from three of the clock the day before, there had
fifteen several armados assailed her; and all so ill approved their
entertainment, as they were by the break of day far more willing
to <a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref534">hearken to a composition</a> than hastily to make any more
assaults or entries. But as the day increased so our men decreased;
and as the light grew more and more, by so much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
grew our discomforts. For none appeared in sight but enemies,
saving one small ship called the <i>Pilgrim</i>, commanded by Jacob
Whiddon, who hovered all night to see the success; but in the
morning was hunted like a hare among many ravenous hounds, but
escaped.</p>

<p>All the powder of the <i>Revenge</i> to the last barrel was now
spent, all her pikes broken, forty of her best men slain, and the
most part of the rest hurt. In the beginning of the fight she had
but one hundred free from sickness, and fourscore and ten sick.
A small troop to man such a ship, and a weak garrison to resist
so mighty an army! By those hundred all was sustained, the volleys,
boardings, and enterings of fifteen ships of war. On the
contrary the Spanish were always supplied with soldiers brought
from every squadron, all manner of arms and powder at will.
Unto ours there remained no comfort at all, no hope, no supply
either of ships, men, or weapons; the masts all beaten overboard,
all her <a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref535">tackle cut asunder</a>, her upper work altogether razed; and,
in effect, even she was with the water, but the very foundation or
bottom of a ship, nothing being left overhead either for flight or
defense.</p>

<p>Sir Richard finding himself in this distress, and unable any
longer to make resistance, having endured in this fifteen hours’
fight the assault of fifteen several armados, all by turns aboard
him, and by estimation eight hundred shot of great artillery, besides
many assaults and entries, and that himself and the ship
must needs be possessed by the enemy, who were now cast in a
ring round about him, the <i>Revenge</i> not able to move one way or
other but as she was moved by the waves and billows of the sea—commanded
the master gunner, whom he knew to be a most
resolute man, to split and sink the ship, that thereby nothing
might remain of glory or victory to the Spaniards, seeing in so
many hours’ fight and with so great a navy, they were not able to
take her, having had fifteen hours’ time, fifteen thousand men,
and fifty and three sail of men-of-war to perform it withal; and
persuaded the company, or as many as he could induce, to yield
themselves unto God, and to the mercy of none else, but, as they
had, like valiant resolute men, repulsed so many enemies, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
should not now shorten the honor of their nation by prolonging
their own lives for a few hours or a few days.</p>

<p>The master gunner readily condescended, and divers others.
But the Captain and the Master were of another opinion and besought
Sir Richard to have care of them, alleging that the Spaniard
would be as ready to entertain a composition as they were
willing to offer the same, and that there being <a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref536">divers sufficient</a> and
valiant men yet living, and whose wounds were not mortal, they
might do their country and prince acceptable service hereafter.</p>

<p>And as the matter was thus in dispute, and Sir Richard refusing
to hearken to any of those reasons, the Master of the
<i>Revenge</i> (while the Captain won unto him the greater party) was
convoyed aboard the <i>General Don Alfonso Bassan</i>. Who, finding
none over hasty to enter the <i>Revenge</i> again, doubting lest Sir
Richard would have blown them up and himself, and perceiving
by the report of the Master of the <i>Revenge</i> his dangerous disposition,
yielded that all their lives should be saved. To this he so
much the rather condescended, as well, as I have said, for fear of
further loss and mischief to themselves, as also for the desire he
had to recover Sir Richard Grenville; whom for his notable valor
he seemed greatly to honor and admire.</p>

<p>When this answer was returned, and that safety of life was
promised, the common sort being now at the end of their peril,
the most drew back from Sir Richard and the gunner, it being no
hard matter to dissuade men from death to life. The master
gunner finding himself and Sir Richard thus prevented and mastered
by the greater number, would have slain himself with a
sword had he not been by force withheld and locked into his
cabin. Then the <i>General</i> sent many boats aboard the <i>Revenge</i>,
and divers of our men, fearing Sir Richard’s disposition, stole
away aboard the <i>General</i> and other ships. Sir Richard, thus
overmatched, was sent unto by Alfonso Bassan to remove out of
the <i>Revenge</i>, the ship being marvelous unsavory, filled with blood
and bodies of dead and wounded men like a slaughter-house.
Sir Richard answered that he might do with his body what he
list, for <a href="#phrases49" title="List of phrases" id="ref537">he esteemed it not</a>; and as he was carried out of the ship
he swooned, and reviving again desired the company to pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
for him. The General used Sir Richard with all humanity, and
left nothing unattempted that tended to his recovery, highly
commending his valor and worthiness and greatly bewailed the
danger wherein he was, being unto them a rare spectacle, to see
one ship turn toward so many enemies, to endure the charge and
boarding of so many huge armados, and to resist and repel the
assaults and entries of so many soldiers.</p>

<p>Sir Richard died, as it is said, the second or third day aboard
the <i>General</i>, and was by them greatly bewailed. What became
of his body, whether it was buried in the sea or on the land we
know not; the comfort that remaineth to his friends is that he
hath ended his life honorably in respect of the reputation
won to his nation and country, and of the same to his posterity,
and that, being dead, he hath not outlived his own honor.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biographical and Historical Note.</b> In the autumn of 1591 a small fleet
of English vessels lay at the Azores to intercept the Spanish treasure ships
from the Indies. On the appearance of the Spanish war-vessels sent to
convoy the treasure ships, the much smaller English fleet took flight with the
exception of the <i>Revenge</i>, commanded by Sir Richard Grenville. Lord
Bacon described the fight as “a defeat exceeding victory.”</p>

<p>This story of the fight of the <i>Revenge</i> was written by Sir Walter Raleigh
(1552-1618), a cousin of Grenville’s. He was an English explorer, colonizer,
and historian. He planted the first English colony in America, on Roanoke
Island, off the coast of North Carolina. Later, he was interested in
an attempt to form a colony in Guiana, and his account of his experiences
is one of the most thrilling adventure stories in the world. His daring
exploits made him a favorite at the court of Queen Elizabeth, but after
her death he gained the ill-will of James I and was executed on a false
charge of piracy and treason.</p>

<h4>ENGLAND AND AMERICA NATURAL ALLIES</h4>

<p class="author">JOHN RICHARD GREEN</p>

<p>Whatever might be the importance of American independence
in the history of England, it was of <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref544">unequaled moment</a> in the
history of the world. If it crippled for a while the supremacy
of the English nation, it founded the supremacy of the English
race. From the hour of American Independence the life of the
English people has flowed not in one current, but in two; and
while the older has shown little signs of lessening, the younger
has fast risen to a greatness which has changed the face of the
world. In 1783 America was a nation of three millions of inhabitants,
scattered thinly along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. It
is now [1877] a nation of forty millions, stretching over the whole
continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In wealth and <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref545">material
energy</a>, as in numbers, it far surpasses the mother-country
from which it sprang. It is already the main branch of the English
people; and in the days that are at hand the main current of
that people’s history must run along the channel not of the
Thames or the Mersey, but of the Hudson and the Mississippi.</p>

<p>But distinct as these currents are, every year proves more
clearly that in spirit the English people are one. The distance
that parted England from America lessens every day. The ties
that unite them grow every day stronger. The social and political
differences that threatened a hundred years ago to form an
<a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref546">impassable barrier</a> between them grow every day less. Against
this silent and <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref547">inevitable drift</a> of things the spirit of <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref548">narrow isolation</a>
on either side the Atlantic struggles in vain. It is possible
that the two branches of the English people will remain forever
separate <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref549">political existences</a>. It is likely enough that the older
of them may again break in twain, and that the English people
in the Pacific may assert as distinct a national life as the two
English peoples on either side the Atlantic. But the spirit, the
influence, of all these branches will remain one.</p>

<p>And in thus remaining one, before half a century is over it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
will change the face of the world. As two hundred millions of
Englishmen fill the valley of the Mississippi, as fifty millions of
Englishmen <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref550">assert their lordship</a> over Australasia, this vast power
will tell through Britain on the old world of Europe, whose nations
will have shrunk into insignificance before it. What the issues
of such a world-wide change may be, not even the wildest dreamer
would dare to dream. But <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref551">one issue is inevitable</a>. In the centuries
that lie before us, the <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref552">primacy of the world</a> will lie with the
English people. <a href="#phrases51" title="List of phrases" id="ref553">English institutions</a>, English speech, English
thought, will become the main features of the political, the social,
and the intellectual life of mankind.</p>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> John Hampden (1594-1643) was a celebrated English
statesman and patriot. When Charles I attempted to impose a tax upon
his subjects without the authority of Parliament, Hampden refused to pay.
The King’s government brought suit against him, and although the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
was decided against Hampden, later the House of Lords ordered the judgment
of the court to be canceled.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Why does the poet think England should be proud of
America? 2. Name some of the rights won by those of “English blood”
before this. 3. Read the lines that tell, in figurative language, what England
and Englishmen will do when their rights are attacked. 4. Notice in the
last stanza how the words <em>harmonies</em>, <em>note</em>, <em>chord</em>, <em>smote</em>, and <em>vibrate</em> all
help to carry out the thought, expressed in figurative language. 5. What
was the “chord which Hampden smote”? 6. Is it still “vibrating”? 7. Did
the poet use the same riming scheme in each of the stanzas?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Thomas Hardy (1840-⸺) was born in Dorsetshire,
England. He was educated at local schools and by private tutors. At the
early age of sixteen he was apprenticed to an architect of Worcester, in
which line of work he made sufficient success to win a prize for design
from the Architectural Association. At the same time he was writing some
verse and an occasional short story, and was at a loss to know which kind
of work to follow for a profession. However, after 1870 he spent most
of his time in writing. He excels as a short story writer, his “The Three
Strangers” appearing in a number of lists of the one hundred best short
stories. Among his other works, <cite>Laughing Stock and Other Verses</cite>, <cite>Under
the Greenwood Tree</cite>, and <cite>A Pair of Blue Eyes</cite> are widely known. Mr.
Hardy was given the Order of Merit in 1910. The Poem “Men Who March
Away,” from <cite>Selected Poems of Thomas Hardy</cite>, was written at the time
the English soldiers were entering the World War.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. What “faith and fire” must the soldier have who freely
enlists in the service of his country in war? 2. Whom does the poet address
in the second stanza? 3. Use other words instead of “purblind prank.”
4. Explain the meaning of the fourth and fifth lines of the third stanza.
5. Why does the poet say the soldiers march away to war ungrieving?
6. What reason is given for the “faith and fire” of the soldiers? 7. In the
fourth stanza, with what belief does the author accredit us? 8. What effect

<h5><span class="smcap">How New England Was Governed</span></h5>

<p>The children had now learned to look upon the chair with an
interest which was almost the same as if it were <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref573">a conscious
being</a> and could remember the many famous people whom it had
held within its arms.</p>

<p>Even Charley, lawless as he was, seemed to feel that this
<a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref574">venerable chair</a> must not be clambered upon or overturned,
although he had no scruple in taking such liberties with every
other chair in the house. Clara treated it with still greater reverence,
often taking occasion to smooth its cushion and to brush
the dust from the carved flowers and <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref575">grotesque figures</a> of its oaken
back and arms. Laurence would sometimes sit a whole hour, especially
at twilight, gazing at the chair and by the spell of his imagination
summoning up its <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref576">ancient occupants</a> to appear in it again.</p>

<p>Little Alice evidently employed herself in a similar way, for
once, when Grandfather had gone abroad, the child was heard
talking with the gentle Lady Arbella as if she were still sitting in
the chair. So sweet a child as little Alice may fitly talk with
angels such as Lady Arbella had long since become.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandfather was soon importuned for more stories about the
chair. He had no difficulty in relating them, for it really seemed
as if every person noted in our early history had on some occasion
or other found repose within its comfortable arms. If Grandfather
took pride in anything, it was in being the possessor of
such an honorable and historic elbow-chair.</p>

<p>“I know not precisely who next got possession of the chair
after Governor Vane went back to England,” said Grandfather,
“but there is reason to believe that President Dunster sat in it
when he held the first commencement at Harvard College. You
have often heard, children, how careful our forefathers were to
give their young people a good education. They had scarcely cut
down trees enough to make room for their own dwellings before
they began to think of establishing a college. Their principal
object was to rear up pious and learned ministers, and hence old
writers call Harvard College a school of the prophets.”</p>

<p>“Is the college a school of the prophets now?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“It is a long while since I <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref577">took my degree</a>, Charley. You must
ask some of the recent graduates,” answered Grandfather. “As
I was telling you, President Dunster sat in Grandfather’s chair
in 1642 when he conferred the degree of bachelor of arts on nine
young men. They were the first in America who had received
that honor. And now, my dear auditors, I must confess that
there are contradictory statements and some uncertainty about
the adventures of the chair for a period of almost ten years.
Some say that it was occupied by your own ancestor, William
Hawthorne, first Speaker of the House of Representatives. I
have nearly satisfied myself, however, that during most of this
questionable period it was literally the chair of state. It gives
me much pleasure to imagine that several successive governors
of Massachusetts sat in it at the <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref578">council board</a>.”</p>

<p>“But, Grandfather,” interposed Charley, who was a matter-of-fact
little person, “what reason have you to imagine so?”</p>

<p>“Pray do imagine it, Grandfather,” said Laurence.</p>

<p>“With Charley’s permission I will,” replied Grandfather,
smiling. “Let us consider it settled, therefore, that Winthrop,
Bellingham, Dudley, and Endicott, each of them, when chosen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
governor, took his seat in our great chair on Election day. In
this chair, likewise, did those excellent governors preside while
holding consultation with the chief councilors of the province,
who were styled assistants. The governor sat in this chair, too,
whenever messages were brought to him from the chamber of
Representatives.”</p>

<p>And here Grandfather took occasion to talk rather tediously
about the nature and forms of government that established themselves
almost spontaneously in Massachusetts and the other New
England colonies. Democracies were the natural growth of the
new world. As to Massachusetts, it was at first intended that
the colony should be governed by a council in London. But in a
little while the people had the whole power in their own hands,
and chose annually the governor, the councilors, and the representatives.
The people of Old England had never enjoyed anything
like the liberties and privileges which the settlers of New
England now possessed. And they did not adopt these modes of
government after long study, but in simplicity, as if there were
no other way for people to be ruled.</p>

<p>“But, Laurence,” continued Grandfather, “when you want
instruction on these points you must seek it in Mr. Bancroft’s
History. I am merely telling the history of a chair. To proceed.
The period during which the governors sat in our chair
was not very full of <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref579">striking incidents</a>. The province was now
established on a secure foundation, but it did not increase so
rapidly as at first, because the Puritans were no longer driven
from England by persecution. However, there was still a quiet
and natural growth. The legislature incorporated towns and
made new purchases of lands from the Indians. A very memorable
event took place in 1643. The colonies of Massachusetts,
Plymouth Connecticut, and New Haven formed a union for the
purpose of assisting each other in difficulties, for mutual defense
against their enemies. They called themselves the United Colonies
of New England.”</p>

<p>“Were they under a government like that of the United
States?” inquired Laurence.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Grandfather; “the different colonies did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
compose one nation together; it was merely a confederacy among
the governments. It somewhat resembled the <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref580">league of the Amphictyons</a>,
which you remember in Grecian history. But to return
to our chair. In 1644 it was highly honored, for Governor Endicott
sat in it when he <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref581">gave audience</a> to an ambassador from the
French governor of Acadia, or Nova Scotia. A treaty of peace
between Massachusetts and the French colony was then signed.”</p>

<p>“Did England allow Massachusetts to make war and peace
with foreign countries?” asked Laurence.</p>

<p>“Massachusetts and the whole of New England were then
almost independent of the mother country,” said Grandfather.
“There was now a civil war in England, and the King, as you may
well suppose, had his hands full at home, and could pay but little
attention to these remote colonies. When the Parliament got
the power into their hands they likewise had enough to do in
keeping down the Cavaliers. Thus New England, like a young
and hardy lad whose father and mother neglect it, was left to
take care of itself. In 1646, King Charles was beheaded. Oliver
Cromwell then became Protector of England, and, as he was a
Puritan himself and had risen by the valor of the English Puritans,
he showed himself a loving and <a href="#phrases55" title="List of phrases" id="ref582">indulgent father</a> to the
Puritan colonies in America.”</p>

<p>Grandfather might have continued to talk in this dull manner
nobody knows how long, but, suspecting that Charley would find
the subject rather dry, he looked sidewise at that vivacious little
fellow and saw him give an involuntary yawn. Whereupon
Grandfather proceeded with the history of the chair, and related
a very entertaining incident which will be found in the next
chapter.</p>

<h6>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h6>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) was a master of the
short story as a means for interpreting character. His ancestors were men
of action—soldiers, seamen, and public officials. But he was unlike them;
all his life he was a dreamer who loved solitude better than society. The
subject of his dreaming was human character, particularly the character
of the Puritan founders of New England. He told many legends of colonial
times, some of them portraying the stern methods of Governor Endicott,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
or telling a humorous story of the Pine-Tree Shillings, or recounting the
weird story of the old gray champion who defied Governor Andros. But
besides these legends he wrote stories, visions of life in which one can
scarcely draw the line between reality and illusion; stories of lovers who
sought vainly for happiness; stories of a great stone face on the mountain
side, and what it signified. Somewhat longer than these tales—<cite>Twice
Told Tales</cite> he called them—are his romances, such as <cite>The Scarlet Letter</cite>,
and <cite>The House of the Seven Gables</cite>. Besides his longer romances
he popularized New England history in the form of stories for children.
From one such book, <cite>Grandfather’s Chair</cite>, these stories have been taken.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Pine-tree Shillings</span></h5>

<p>“According to the most <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref583">authentic records</a>, my dear children,”
said Grandfather, “the chair about this time had the misfortune
to break its leg. It was probably on account of this accident that
it ceased to be the seat of the governors of Massachusetts, for,
assuredly, it would have been <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref584">ominous of evil</a> to the commonwealth
if the chair of state had tottered upon three legs. Being
therefore sold at auction—alas! what a vicissitude for a chair
that had figured in such high company!—our venerable friend
was <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref585">knocked down</a> to a certain Captain John Hull. This old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
gentleman, on carefully examining the maimed chair, discovered
that its broken leg might be clamped with iron and made as
serviceable as ever.”</p>

<p>“Here is the very leg that was broken!” exclaimed Charley,
throwing himself down on the floor to look at it. “And here are
the iron clamps. How well it was mended!”</p>

<p>When they had all sufficiently examined the broken leg Grandfather
told them a story about Captain John Hull and the Pine-tree
Shillings.</p>

<p>The Captain John Hull aforesaid was the mint-master of
Massachusetts, and coined all the money that was made there.
This was a new line of business, for in the earlier days of the
colony the <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref586">current coinage</a> consisted of gold and silver money of
England, Portugal, and Spain. These coins being scarce, the
people were often forced to <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref587">barter their commodities</a> instead of
selling them.</p>

<p>For instance, if a man wanted to buy a coat, he perhaps exchanged
a bear-skin for it. If he wished for a barrel of molasses,
he might purchase it with a pile of pine boards. Musket-bullets
were used instead of farthings. The Indians had a sort of money
called wampum, which was made of clam-shells, and this <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref588">strange
sort of specie</a> was likewise taken in payment of debts by the
English settlers. Bank-bills had never been heard of. There was
not money enough of any kind, in many parts of the country,
to pay the salaries of the ministers, so that they sometimes had
to take quintals of fish, bushels of corn, or cords of wood instead
of silver or gold.</p>

<p>As the people grew more numerous and their trade one with
another increased, the want of current money was still more
sensibly felt. To supply the demand the general court passed a
law for establishing a coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences.
Captain John Hull was appointed to manufacture this
money, and was to have about one shilling out of every twenty
to pay him for the trouble of making them.</p>

<p>Hereupon all the old silver in the colony was handed over to
Captain John Hull. The battered silver cans and tankards, I
suppose, and silver buckles, and broken spoons, and silver buttons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
of worn-out coats, and silver hilts of swords that had figured at
court—all such curious old articles were doubtless thrown into
the melting-pot together. But by far the greater part of the silver
consisted of bullion from the mines of South America, which the
<a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref589">English buccaneers</a>—who were little better than pirates—had
taken from the Spaniards and brought to Massachusetts.</p>

<p>All this old and new silver being melted down and coined, the
result was an immense amount of splendid shillings, sixpences,
and threepences. Each had the date 1652 on the one side and
the figure of a pine tree on the other. Hence they were called
pine-tree shillings. And for every twenty shillings that he coined,
you will remember, Captain John Hull was entitled to put one
shilling into his own pocket.</p>

<p>The magistrates soon began to suspect that the mint-master
would have the best of the bargain. They offered him a large
sum of money if he would but give up that twentieth shilling
which he was continually dropping into his own pocket. But
Captain Hull declared himself perfectly satisfied with the shilling.
And well he might be, for so diligently did he labor that in a few
years his pockets, his money-bags, and his strong box were over-flowing
with pine-tree shillings. This was probably the case
when he came into possession of Grandfather’s chair; and, as he
had worked so hard at the mint, it was certainly proper that he
should have a comfortable chair to rest himself in.</p>

<p>When the mint-master had grown very rich, a young man,
Samuel Sewell by name, came a-courting to his only daughter.
His daughter—whose name I do not know, but we will call her
Betsey—was a fine, hearty damsel, by no means so slender as
some young ladies of our own days. On the contrary, having
always fed heartily on pumpkin pies, doughnuts, Indian puddings,
and other Puritan dainties, she was as round and plump as a pudding
herself. With this round, rosy Miss Betsey did Samuel
Sewell fall in love. As he was a young man of good character,
industrious in his business, and a member of the church, the mint-master
very readily gave his consent.</p>

<p>“Yes, you may take her,” said he, in his rough way, “and you’ll
find her a heavy burden enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>On the wedding-day we may suppose that honest John Hull
dressed himself in a plum-colored coat, all the buttons of which
were made of pine-tree shillings. The buttons of his waistcoat
were sixpences, and the knees of his small clothes were buttoned
with silver threepences. Thus attired, he sat with great dignity
in Grandfather’s chair, and, being a portly old gentleman, he
completely filled it from elbow to elbow. On the opposite side of
the room, between her bridesmaids, sat Miss Betsey. She was
blushing with all her might, and looked like a full-blown peony
or a great red apple.</p>

<p>There, too, was the bridegroom, dressed in a fine purple coat
and gold-lace waistcoat, with as much other finery as the Puritan
laws and customs would allow him to put on. His hair was
cropped close to his head, because Governor Endicott had forbidden
any man to wear it below the ears. But he was a very
<a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref590">personable young man</a>, and so thought the bridesmaids and Miss
Betsey herself.</p>

<p>The mint-master also was pleased with his new son-in-law,
especially as he had courted Miss Betsey out of pure love, and
had said nothing at all about her portion. So, when the marriage
ceremony was over, Captain Hull whispered a word to two
of his men-servants, who immediately went out, and soon returned
lugging in a large pair of scales. They were such a pair
as wholesale merchants use for weighing <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref591">bulky commodities</a>, and
quite a bulky commodity was now to be weighed in them.</p>

<p>“Daughter Betsey,” said the mint-master, “get into one side
of these scales.”</p>

<p>Miss Betsey—or Mrs. Sewell, as we must now call her—did
as she was bid, like a dutiful child, without any question of the
why and wherefore. But what her father could mean, unless to
make her husband pay for her by the pound (in which case she
would have been a dear bargain), she had not the least idea.</p>

<p>“And now,” said honest John Hull to the servants, “bring that
box hither.”</p>

<p>The box to which the mint-master pointed was a huge, square,
iron-bound oaken chest; it was big enough, my children, for all
four of you to play at hide-and-seek in. The servants tugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
with might and main, but could not lift this <a href="#phrases56" title="List of phrases" id="ref592">enormous receptacle</a>,
and were finally obliged to drag it across the floor. Captain
Hull, then took a key from his girdle, unlocked the chest, and
lifted its ponderous lid. Behold! it was full to the brim of bright
pine-tree shillings fresh from the mint, and Samuel Sewell began
to think that his father-in-law had got possession of all the money
in the Massachusetts treasury. But it was only the mint-master’s
honest share of the coinage.</p>

<p>Then the servants, at Captain Hull’s command, heaped double
handfuls of shillings into one side of the scales while Betsey
remained in the other. Jingle, jingle, went the shillings as handful
after handful was thrown in, till, plump and ponderous as she
was, they fairly weighed the young lady from the floor.</p>

<p>“There, son Sewell!” cried the honest mint-master, resuming
his seat in Grandfather’s chair, “take these shillings for my
daughter’s portion. Use her kindly and thank Heaven for her.
It is not every wife that’s worth her weight in silver.”</p>

<p>The children laughed heartily at this legend, and would hardly
be convinced but that Grandfather had made it out of his own
head. He assured them faithfully, however, that he had found
it in the pages of a grave historian, and had merely tried to tell
it in a somewhat funnier style. As for Samuel Sewell, he afterward
became chief justice of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>“Well, Grandfather,” remarked Clara, “if wedding portions
nowadays were paid as Miss Betsey’s was, young ladies would
not pride themselves upon an airy figure, as many of them do.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Stamp Act</span></h5>

<p>“Charley, my boy,” said Grandfather, “do you remember who
was the last occupant of the chair?”</p>

<p>“It was Lieutenant-governor Hutchinson,” answered Charley.
“Sir Francis Bernard, the new governor, had given him the chair
instead of putting it away in the garret of the Province-house.
And when we took leave of Hutchinson he was sitting by his fireside
and thinking of the past adventures of the chair and of what
was to come.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Grandfather, “and you recollect that this
was in 1763 or thereabouts, at the close of the Old French War.
Now, that you may fully comprehend the remaining adventures
of the chair, I must make some brief remarks on the situation
and character of the New England colonies at this period.”</p>

<p>So Grandfather spoke of the earnest loyalty of our fathers
during the Old French War and after the conquest of Canada
had brought that war to a triumphant close.</p>

<p>The people loved and reverenced the King of England even
more than if the ocean had not rolled its waves between him
and them, for at the distance of three thousand miles they could
not discover his bad qualities and imperfections. Their love was
increased by the dangers which they had encountered in order
to heighten his glory and extend his dominion. Throughout the
war the American colonists had fought side by side with the
soldiers of Old England, and nearly thirty thousand young men
had laid down their lives for the honor of King George. And
the survivors loved him the better because they had done and
suffered so much for his sake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>But there were some circumstances that caused America to
feel more independent of England than at an earlier period.
Canada and Acadia had now become British provinces, and our
fathers were no longer afraid of the bands of French and Indians
who used to assault them in old times. For a century and a half
this had been the great terror of New England. Now the old
French soldier was driven from the north forever. And even
had it been otherwise, the English colonies were growing so populous
and powerful that they might have felt fully able to protect
themselves without any help from England.</p>

<p>There were thoughtful and <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref593">sagacious men</a> who began to doubt
whether a great country like America would always be content
to remain under the government of an island three thousand
miles away. This was the more doubtful because the English
Parliament had long ago made laws which were intended to be
very beneficial to England at the expense of America. By these
laws the colonists were forbidden to manufacture articles for
their own use or to carry on trade with any nation but the English.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Grandfather, “if King George III and his
counselors had considered these things wisely, they would have
taken another course than they did. But when they saw how
rich and populous the colonies had grown, their first thought was
how they might make more profit out of them than heretofore.
England was enormously in debt at the close of the Old French
War, and it was pretended that this debt had been contracted for
the defense of the American colonies, and that therefore a part of
it ought to be paid by them.”</p>

<p>“Why, this was nonsense!” exclaimed Charley. “Did not our
fathers spend their lives, and their money too, to get Canada for
King George?”</p>

<p>“True, they did,” said Grandfather, “and they told the English
rulers so. But the King and his ministers would not listen to
good advice. In 1765 the British Parliament passed a stamp act.”</p>

<p>“What was that?” inquired Charley.</p>

<p>“The stamp act,” replied Grandfather, “was a law by which
all deeds, bonds, and other papers of the same kind were ordered
to be marked with the king’s stamp, and without this mark they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
were declared <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref594">illegal and void</a>. Now, in order to get a blank
sheet of paper with the king’s stamp upon it, people were obliged
to pay threepence more than the actual value of the paper. And
this extra sum of threepence was a tax and was to be paid into
the king’s treasury.”</p>

<p>“I am sure threepence was not worth quarreling about!” remarked
Clara.</p>

<p>“It was not for threepence, nor for any amount of money, that
America quarreled with England,” replied Grandfather; “it was
for a great principle. The colonists were determined not to be
taxed except by their own representatives. They said that
neither the King and Parliament nor any other power on earth
had a right to take their money out of their pockets unless they
freely gave it. And, rather than pay threepence when it was
unjustly demanded, they resolved to sacrifice all the wealth of
the country, and their lives along with it. They therefore made
a most <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref595">stubborn resistance</a> to the stamp act.”</p>

<p>“That was noble!” exclaimed Laurence. “I understand how
it was. If they had quietly paid the tax of threepence, they
would have ceased to be freemen and would have become tributaries
of England. And so they contended about a great question
of right and wrong, and put everything at stake for it.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Laurence,” said Grandfather, “and it was really
amazing and terrible to see what a change came over <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref596">the aspect
of the people</a> the moment the English Parliament had passed this
<a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref597">oppressive act</a>. The former history of our chair, my children,
has given you some idea of what a harsh, unyielding, stern set of
men the old Puritans were. For a good many years back, however,
it had seemed as if these characteristics were disappearing.
But no sooner did England offer wrong to the colonies than the
descendants of the early settlers proved that they had the same
kind of temper as their forefathers. The moment before, New
England appeared like a humble and loyal <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref598">subject of the Crown</a>;
the next instant she showed the grim, dark features of an old
king-resisting Puritan.”</p>

<p>Grandfather spoke briefly of the <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref599">public measures</a> that were
taken in opposition to the stamp act. As this law affected all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
American colonies alike, it naturally led them to think of consulting
together in order to procure its repeal. For this purpose
the legislature of Massachusetts proposed that delegates from
every colony should meet in congress. Accordingly, nine colonies,
both Northern and Southern, sent delegates to the city of
New York.</p>

<p>“And did they consult about going to war with England?”
asked Charley.</p>

<p>“No, Charley,” answered Grandfather; “a great deal of talking
was yet to be done before England and America could come
to blows. The Congress stated the rights and grievances of the
colonists. They sent a <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref600">humble petition to the King</a> and a memorial
to the Parliament beseeching that the stamp act might
be repealed. This was all that the delegates had it in their
power to do.”</p>

<p>“They might as well have stayed at home, then,” said Charley.</p>

<p>“By no means,” replied Grandfather. “It was a most important
and <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref601">memorable event</a>, this first coming together of the
American people by their representatives from the North and
South. If England had been wise, she would have trembled at
the first word that was spoken in such an assembly.”</p>

<p>These <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref602">remonstrances and petitions</a>, as Grandfather observed,
were the work of grave, thoughtful, and prudent men. Meantime
the young and hot-headed people went to work in their own
way. It is probable that the petitions of Congress would have
had little or no effect on the British statesmen if the <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref603">violent
deeds</a> of the American people had not shown how much excited
the people were. Liberty Tree was soon heard of in England.</p>

<p>“What was Liberty Tree?” inquired Clara.</p>

<p>“It was an old elm tree,” answered Grandfather, “which stood
near the corner of Essex street, opposite the Boylston Market.
Under the spreading branches of this great tree the people used
to assemble whenever they wished to express their feelings and
opinions. Thus, after a while it seemed as if the liberty of the
country was connected with Liberty Tree.”</p>

<p>“It was glorious fruit for a tree to bear,” remarked Laurence.</p>

<p>“It bore strange fruit sometimes,” said Grandfather. “One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
morning in August, 1765, two figures were found hanging on the
sturdy branches of Liberty Tree. They were dressed in square-skirted
coats and smallclothes, and as their wigs hung down over
their faces they looked like real men. One was intended to represent
the Earl of Bute, who was supposed to have advised the
King to tax America. The other was meant for the effigy of
Andrew Oliver, a gentleman belonging to one of the most respectable
families in Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>“What harm had he done?” inquired Charley.</p>

<p>“The King had appointed him to be distributer of the stamps,”
answered Grandfather. “Mr. Oliver would have made a great
deal of money by this business; but the people frightened him
so much by <a href="#phrases57" title="List of phrases" id="ref604">hanging him in effigy</a>, and afterward by breaking
into his house, that he promised to have nothing to do with the
stamps. And all the King’s friends throughout America were
compelled to make the same promise.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">British Soldiers Stationed in Boston</span></h5>

<p>The next evening, Clara, who remembered that our chair had
been left standing in the rain under Liberty Tree, earnestly besought
Grandfather to tell when and where it had next found
shelter. Perhaps she was afraid that the venerable chair, by
being <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref605">exposed to the inclemency</a> of a September gale, might get
the rheumatism in its aged joints.</p>

<p>“The chair,” said Grandfather, “after the ceremony of Mr.
Oliver’s oath, appears to have been quite forgotten by the multitude.
Indeed, being much bruised and rather rickety, owing to
the violent treatment it had suffered from the Hutchinson mob,
most people would have thought that its days of usefulness were
over. Nevertheless, it was conveyed away <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref606">under cover of the
night</a> and <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref607">committed to the care</a> of a <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref608">skillful joiner</a>. He doctored
our old friend so successfully that in the course of a few days it
made its appearance in the public room of the British Coffee-house
in King Street.”</p>

<p>“But why did not Mr. Hutchinson get possession of it again?”
inquired Charley.</p>

<p>“I know not,” answered Grandfather, “unless he considered it
a dishonor and disgrace to the chair to have stood under Liberty
Tree. At all events, he suffered it to remain at the British
Coffee-house, which was the principal hotel in Boston. It could
not possibly have found a situation where it would be more in
the midst of business and bustle, or would witness more important
events, or be occupied by a greater variety of persons.”</p>

<p>Grandfather went on to tell the proceedings of the despotic
King and ministry of England after the repeal of the stamp act.
They could not bear to think that their right to tax America
should be disputed by the people. In the year 1767, therefore,
they caused Parliament to pass an act for laying a duty on tea
and some other articles that were in general use. Nobody could
now buy a pound of tea without paying a tax to King George.
This scheme was pretty <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref609">craftily contrived</a>, for the women of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
America were very fond of tea, and did not like to give up the
use of it.</p>

<p>But the people were as much opposed to this new act of Parliament
as they had been to the stamp act. England, however, was
determined that they should submit. In order to compel their
obedience two regiments, consisting of more than seven hundred
British soldiers, were sent to Boston. They arrived in September,
1768, and were landed on Long Wharf. Thence they marched to
<a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref610">the Common</a> with loaded muskets, fixed bayonets, and great
<a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref611">pomp and parade</a>. So now at last the free town of Boston was
guarded and overawed by red-coats as it had been in the days of
old Sir Edmond Andros.</p>

<p>In the month of November more regiments arrived. There
were now four thousand troops in Boston. The Common was
whitened with their tents. Some of the soldiers were lodged in
Faneuil Hall, which the inhabitants looked upon as a consecrated
place because it had been the scene of a great many meetings in
favor of liberty. One regiment was placed in the Town House,
which we now call the Old State House. The lower floor of this
edifice had hitherto been used by the merchants as an exchange.
In the upper stories were the chambers of the judges, the representatives,
and the governor’s council. The <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref612">venerable councilors</a>
could not assemble to consult about the welfare of the province
without being challenged by sentinels and passing among the
bayonets of the British soldiers.</p>

<p>Sentinels likewise were posted at the lodgings of the officers
in many parts of the town. When the inhabitants approached,
they were greeted by the sharp question, “Who goes there?”
while the rattle of the soldier’s musket was heard as he presented
it against their breasts. There was no quiet even on the Sabbath
day. The pious descendants of the Puritans were shocked by
the uproar of military music, the drum, fife, and bugle drowning
the holy organ-peal and the voices of the singers. It would
appear as if the British took every method to insult the feelings
of the people.</p>

<p>“Grandfather,” cried Charley, impatiently, “the people did
not go to fighting half soon enough! These British red-coats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
ought to have been driven back to their vessels the very moment
they landed on Long Wharf.”</p>

<p>“Many a hot-headed young man said the same as you do,
Charley,” answered Grandfather, “but the elder and wiser people
saw that the time was not yet come. Meanwhile, let us take
another peep at our old chair.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it drooped its head, I know,” said Charley, “when it
saw how the province was disgraced. Its old Puritan friends never
would have borne such doings.”</p>

<p>“The chair,” proceeded Grandfather, “was now continually
occupied by some of the high Tories, as the King’s friends were
called, who frequented the British Coffee House. Officers of the
custom-house too, which stood on the opposite side of King Street,
often sat in the chair wagging their tongues against John
Hancock.”</p>

<p>“Why against him?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“Because he was a great merchant and contended against
paying duties to the King,” said Grandfather.</p>

<p>“Well, frequently, no doubt, the officers of the British regiments,
when not on duty, used to fling themselves into the arms
of our venerable chair. Fancy one of them a red-nosed captain
in his scarlet uniform, playing with the hilt of his sword and
making a circle of his brother officers merry with ridiculous jokes
at the expense of the poor Yankees. And perhaps he would call
for a bottle of wine or a steaming bowl of punch and drink confusion
to all rebels.”</p>

<p>“Our grave old chair must have been scandalized at such
scenes,” observed Laurence—“the chair that had been the Lady
Arbella’s and which the holy apostle Eliot had consecrated.”</p>

<p>“It certainly was little less than sacrilege,” replied Grandfather;
“but the time was coming when even the churches where
hallowed pastors had long preached the word of God were to be
torn down or desecrated by the British troops. Some years passed,
however, before such things were done.”</p>

<p>Grandfather now told his auditors that in 1769 Sir Francis
Bernard went to England, after having been governor of Massachusetts
ten years. He was a gentleman of many good qualities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
an excellent scholar, and a friend to learning. But he was naturally
of an <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref613">arbitrary disposition</a>, and he had been bred at the
University of Oxford, where young men were taught that the
<a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref614">divine right of kings</a> was the only thing to be regarded in matters
of government. Such ideas were ill adapted to please the people
of Massachusetts. They rejoiced to get rid of Sir Francis Bernard,
but liked his successor, Lieutenant-governor Hutchinson, no
better than himself.</p>

<p>About this period the people were much incensed at an act
committed by a person who held an office in the custom-house.
Some lads or young men were snowballing his windows. He
fired a musket at them and killed a poor boy only eleven years
old. This event made a great noise in town and country, and
much increased the resentment that was already felt against the
servants of the Crown.</p>

<p>“Now, children,” said Grandfather, “I wish to make you comprehend
the position of the British troops in King Street. This is
the same which we now call State Street. On the south side of
the Town House, or Old State House, was what military men call
a <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref615">court of guard</a>, defended by two brass cannons which pointed
directly at one of the doors of the above edifice. A large party
of soldiers were always stationed in the court of guard. The
custom-house stood at a little distance down King Street, nearly
where the Suffolk Bank now stands, and a sentinel was continually
pacing before its front.”</p>

<p>“I shall remember this tomorrow,” said Charley, “and I will
go to State Street, so as to see exactly where the British troops
were stationed.”</p>

<p>“And before long,” observed Grandfather, “I shall have to
relate an event which made King Street sadly famous on both
sides of the Atlantic. The history of our chair will soon bring
us to this melancholy business.”</p>

<p>Here Grandfather described the state of things which arose
from the ill-will that existed between the inhabitants and the
red-coats. The old and sober part of the townspeople were very
angry at the government for sending soldiers to overawe them.
But those gray-headed men were cautious, and kept their thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
and feelings in their own breasts, without putting themselves in
the way of the British bayonets.</p>

<p>The younger people, however, could hardly be kept <a href="#phrases58" title="List of phrases" id="ref616">within
such prudent limits</a>. They reddened with wrath at the very sight
of a soldier, and would have been willing to come to blows with
them at any moment. For it was their opinion that every tap of
a British drum within the peninsula of Boston was an insult to the
brave old town.</p>

<p>“It was sometimes the case,” continued Grandfather, “that
affrays happened between such wild young men as these and
small parties of the soldiers. No weapons had hitherto been
used except fists or cudgels. But when men have loaded muskets
in their hands, it is easy to foretell that they will soon be turned
against the bosoms of those who provoke their anger.”</p>

<p>“Grandfather,” said little Alice, looking fearfully into his
face, “your voice sounds as though you were going to tell us
something awful.”</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">The Boston Massacre</span></h5>

<p>Little Alice, by her last remark, proved herself a good judge
of what was expressed by the tones of Grandfather’s voice. He
had given the above description of the enmity between the townspeople
and the soldiers in order to prepare the minds of his auditors
for a very terrible event. It was one that did more to
heighten the quarrel between England and America than anything
that had yet occurred.</p>

<p>Without further preface Grandfather began the story of the
Boston Massacre.</p>

<p>It was now the 3d of March, 1770. The sunset music of the
British regiments was heard as usual throughout the town. The
shrill fife and rattling drum <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref617">awoke the echoes</a> in King Street while
the last ray of sunshine was <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref618">lingering on the cupola</a> of the Town
House, And now all the sentinels were posted. One of them
marched up and down before the custom-house, treading a short
path through the snow and longing for the time when he would
be dismissed to the warm fireside of the guard-room. Meanwhile,
Captain Preston was perhaps sitting in our great chair
before the hearth of the British Coffee House. In the course of
the evening there were two or three slight commotions which
seemed to indicate that trouble was at hand. Small parties of
young men stood at the corners of the streets or walked along the
narrow pavements. Squads of soldiers who were dismissed from
duty passed by them, shoulder to shoulder, with the regular step
which they had learned at the drill. Whenever these encounters
took place it appeared to be the object of the young men to treat
the soldiers with as much incivility as possible.</p>

<p>“Turn out, you <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref619">lobster-backs</a>!” one would say. “Crowd them
off the sidewalks!” another would cry. “A red-coat has no right
in Boston streets!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref620">rebel rascals</a>!” perhaps the soldiers would reply,
glaring fiercely at the young men. “Some day or other we’ll make
our way through Boston streets at the point of the bayonet!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>Once or twice such disputes as these brought on a scuffle, which
passed off, however, without attracting much notice. About
eight o’clock, for some unknown cause, an alarm bell rang loudly
and hurriedly.</p>

<p>At the sound many people ran out of their houses, supposing
it to be an alarm of fire. But there were no flames to be seen, nor
was there any smell of smoke in the clear, frosty air, so that most
of the townsmen went back to their own firesides and sat talking
with their wives and children about the calamities of the times.
Others who were younger and less prudent remained in the streets,
for there seems to have been a presentiment that some strange
event was on the eve of taking place.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, not far from nine o’clock, several young
men passed by the Town House and walked down King Street.
The sentinel was still on his post in front of the custom-house,
pacing to and fro, while as he turned, a gleam of light from some
neighboring window glittered on the barrel of his musket. At
no great distance were the barracks and the guard-house, where
his comrades were probably telling stories of battle and bloodshed.</p>

<p>Down toward the custom-house, as I told you, came a party
of wild young men. When they drew near the sentinel he halted
on his post and took his musket from his shoulder, ready to present
the bayonet at their breasts.</p>

<p>“Who goes there?” he cried, in the gruff, <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref621">peremptory tones</a> of
a soldier’s challenge.</p>

<p>The young men, being Boston boys, felt as if they had a right
to walk their own streets without being <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref622">accountable to</a> a British
red-coat, even though he challenged them in King George’s name.
They made some rude answer to the sentinel. There was a dispute,
or perhaps a scuffle. Other soldiers heard the noise, and
ran hastily from the barracks to assist their comrades. At the
same time many of the townspeople rushed into King Street by
various avenues and gathered in a crowd round about the custom-house.
It seemed wonderful how such a multitude had started
up all of a sudden.</p>

<p>The wrongs and insults which the people had been suffering
for many months now kindled them into a rage. They threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
snowballs and lumps of ice at the soldiers. As the tumult grew
louder it reached the ears of Captain Preston, the officer of the
day. He immediately ordered eight soldiers of the main guard
to take their muskets and follow him. They marched across the
street, forcing their way roughly through the crowd and pricking
the townspeople with their bayonets.</p>

<p>A gentleman (it was Henry Knox, afterward general of the
American artillery) caught Captain Preston’s arm.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, sir,” exclaimed he, “take heed what you
do or there will be bloodshed!”</p>

<p>“Stand aside!” answered Captain Preston, haughtily. “Do
not interfere, sir. Leave me to manage the affair.”</p>

<p>Arriving at the sentinel’s post, Captain Preston drew up his
men in a semicircle with their faces to the crowd and their rear
to the custom-house. When the people saw the officer and beheld
the threatening attitude with which the soldiers fronted them
their rage became almost uncontrollable.</p>

<p>“Fire, you lobster-backs!” bellowed some.</p>

<p>“You dare not fire, you cowardly red-coats!” cried others.</p>

<p>“Rush upon them!” shouted many voices. “Drive the rascals
to their barracks! Down with them! Down with them! Let
them fire if they dare!”</p>

<p>Amid the uproar the soldiers stood glaring at the people with
the fierceness of men whose trade was to shed blood.</p>

<p>Oh, what a crisis had now arrived! Up to this very moment
the angry feelings between England and America might have
been pacified. England had but to stretch out the hand of reconciliation
and acknowledge that she had hitherto mistaken her
rights, but would do so no more. Then the ancient bonds of brotherhood
would again have been knit together as firmly as in old
times. The habit of loyalty which had grown as strong as instinct
was not utterly overcome. The perils shared, the victories won,
in the Old French War, when the soldiers of the colonies fought
side by side with their comrades from beyond the sea, were unforgotten
yet. England was still that beloved country which the
colonists called their home. King George, though he had frowned
upon America, was still reverenced as a father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>But should the King’s soldiers shed one drop of American
blood, then it was a quarrel to the death. Never, never would
America rest satisfied until she had torn down the royal authority
and trampled it in the dust.</p>

<p>“Fire if you dare, villains!” hoarsely shouted the people while
the muzzles of the muskets were turned upon them. “You dare
not fire!”</p>

<p>They appeared ready to rush upon the level bayonets. Captain
Preston waved his sword and uttered a command which
could not be distinctly heard amid the uproar of shouts that issued
from a hundred throats. But his soldiers deemed that he had
spoken the <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref623">fatal mandate</a>, “Fire!” The flash of their muskets
lighted up the street, and the report rang loudly between the
edifices. It was said, too, that the figure of a man with a cloth
hanging down over his face was seen to step into the balcony
of the custom-house and discharge a musket at the crowd.</p>

<p>A gush of smoke had overspread the scene. It rose heavily, as
if it were <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref624">loath to reveal</a> the dreadful spectacle beneath it. Eleven
of the sons of New England lay stretched upon the street. Some,
sorely wounded, were struggling to rise again. Others stirred not
nor groaned, for they were past all pain. Blood was streaming
upon the snow, and that purple stain in the midst of King Street,
though it melted away in the next day’s sun, was never forgotten
nor forgiven by the people.</p>

<p>Grandfather was interrupted by the violent sobs of little Alice.
In his earnestness he had neglected to soften down the narrative
so that it might not terrify the heart of this <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref625">unworldly infant</a>.
Since Grandfather began the history of our chair little Alice had
listened to many tales of war, but probably the idea had never
really impressed itself upon her mind that men had shed the blood
of their fellow-creatures. And now that this idea was forcibly
presented to her, it affected the sweet child with bewilderment
and horror.</p>

<p>“I ought to have remembered our dear little Alice,” said
Grandfather reproachfully to himself. “Oh, what a pity! Her
heavenly nature has now received its first impression of earthly
sin and violence.—Well, Clara, take her to bed and comfort her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Heaven grant that she may dream away the recollection of the
Boston massacre!”</p>

<p>“Grandfather,” said Charley when Clara and little Alice had
retired, “did not the people rush upon the soldiers and take
revenge?”</p>

<p>“The town drums beat to arms,” replied Grandfather, “the
alarm-bells rang, and an immense multitude rushed into King
Street. Many of them had weapons in their hands. The British
prepared to defend themselves. A whole regiment was drawn up
in the street expecting an attack, for the townsmen appeared
ready to throw themselves upon the bayonets.”</p>

<p>“And how did it end?” asked Charley.</p>

<p>“Governor Hutchinson hurried to the spot,” said Grandfather,
“and besought the people to have patience, promising that <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref626">strict
justice</a> should be done. A day or two afterward the British troops
were withdrawn from town and stationed at Castle William.
Captain Preston and the eight soldiers were tried for murder, but
none of them were found guilty. The judges told the jury that
the insults and violence which had been offered to the soldiers
justified them in firing at the mob.”</p>

<p>“The Revolution,” observed Laurence, who had said but little
during the evening, “was not such a calm, <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref627">majestic movement</a> as
I supposed. I do not love to hear of <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref628">mobs and broils</a> in the street.
These things were unworthy of the people when they had such a
great object to accomplish.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, the world has seen no grander movement than
that of our Revolution from first to last,” said Grandfather. “The
people, to a man, were full of a great and noble sentiment. True,
there may be much fault to find with their mode of expressing this
sentiment, but they knew no better; the <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref629">necessity was upon them</a>
to act out their feelings in the best manner they could. We must
forgive what was wrong in their actions, and look into their hearts
and minds for the honorable motives that impelled them.”</p>

<p>“And I suppose,” said Laurence, “there were men who knew
how to act worthily of what they felt.”</p>

<p>“There were many such,” replied Grandfather, “and we will
speak of some of them hereafter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandfather here made a pause. That night Charley had a
dream about the Boston massacre, and thought that he himself
was in the crowd and struck down Captain Preston with a great
club. Laurence dreamed that he was sitting in our great chair
at the window of the British Coffee-house, and beheld the whole
scene which Grandfather had described. It seemed to him, in his
dream, that if the townspeople and the soldiers would have but
heard him speak a single word, all the slaughter might have been
averted. But there was such an uproar that it drowned his voice.</p>

<p>The next morning the two boys went together to State Street
and stood on the very spot where the first blood of the Revolution
had been shed. The Old State House was still there, presenting
almost the same aspect that it had worn on that memorable evening
one and seventy years ago. It is the <a href="#phrases59" title="List of phrases" id="ref630">sole remaining witness</a>
of the Boston massacre.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Some Famous Portraits</span></h5>

<p>The next evening the <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref631">astral lamp</a> was lighted earlier than
usual, because Laurence was very much engaged in looking over
the collection of portraits which had been his New Year’s gift
from Grandfather.</p>

<p>Among them he found the features of more than one famous
personage who had been connected with the adventures of our old
chair. Grandfather bade him draw the table nearer to the fireside,
and they looked over the portraits together, while Clara and
Charley likewise lent their attention. As for little Alice, she sat
in Grandfather’s lap, and seemed to see the very men alive whose
faces were there represented.</p>

<p>Turning over the volume, Laurence came to the portrait of a
stern, grim-looking man in plain attire, of much more modern
fashion than that of the old Puritans. But the face might well
have befitted one of those iron-hearted men. Beneath the portrait
was the name of Samuel Adams.</p>

<p>“He was a man of great note in all the doings that brought
about the Revolution,” said Grandfather. “His character was
such that it seemed as if one of the ancient Puritans had been sent
back to earth to <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref632">animate the people’s hearts</a> with the same <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref633">abhorrence
of tyranny</a> that had distinguished the earliest settlers. He
was as religious as they, as stern and inflexible, and as deeply <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref634">imbued
with democratic principles</a>. He, better than any one else,
may be taken as a representative of the people of New England,
and of the spirit with which they engaged in the Revolutionary
struggle. He was a poor man, and earned his bread by a humble
occupation, but with his tongue and pen he made the King of England
tremble on his throne. Remember him, my children, as one
of the strong men of our country.”</p>

<p>“Here is one whose looks show a very different character,”
observed Laurence, turning to the portrait of John Hancock. “I
should think, by his splendid dress and courtly aspect, that he
was one of the King’s friends.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>

<p>“There never was a greater contrast than between Samuel
Adams and John Hancock,” said Grandfather, “yet they were
of the same side in politics, and had an <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref635">equal agency</a> in the Revolution.
Hancock was born to the inheritance of the largest fortune
in New England. His tastes and habits were aristocratic.
He loved <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref636">gorgeous attire</a>, a splendid mansion, magnificent furniture,
stately festivals, and all that was glittering and pompous in
external things. His manners were so polished that there stood
not a nobleman at the footstool of King George’s throne who was
a more <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref637">skillful courtier</a> than John Hancock might have been.
Nevertheless, he in his embroidered clothes and Samuel Adams in
his threadbare coat wrought together in the cause of liberty.
Adams acted from pure and rigid principle. Hancock, though he
loved his country, yet thought quite as much of his own popularity
as he did of the people’s rights. It is remarkable that these two
men, so very different as I describe them, were the only two
exempted from pardon by the King’s proclamation.”</p>

<p>On the next leaf of the book was the portrait of General
Joseph Warren. Charley recognized the name, and said that here
was a greater man than either Hancock or Adams.</p>

<p>“Warren was an eloquent and able patriot,” replied Grandfather.
“He deserves a lasting memory for his zealous efforts
in behalf of liberty. No man’s voice was more powerful in Faneuil
Hall than Joseph Warren’s. If his death had not happened so
early in the contest, he would probably have gained a high name
as a soldier.”</p>

<p>The next portrait was a venerable man who held his thumb
under his chin, and through his spectacles appeared to be attentively
reading a manuscript.</p>

<p>“Here we see the most illustrious Boston boy that ever lived,”
said Grandfather. “This is Benjamin Franklin. But I will not
try to compress into a few sentences the character of the sage
who, as a Frenchman expressed it, snatched the lightning from
the sky and the scepter from a tyrant. Mr. Sparks must help
you to the knowledge of Franklin.”</p>

<p>The book likewise contained portraits of James Otis and
Josiah Quincy. Both of them, Grandfather observed, were men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
of wonderful talents and true patriotism. Their voices were
like the stirring tones of a trumpet arousing the country to defend
its freedom. Heaven seemed to have provided a greater number
of eloquent men than had appeared at any other period, in order
that the people might be fully instructed as to their wrongs and
the method of resistance.</p>

<p>“It is marvelous,” said Grandfather, “to see how many powerful
writers, orators, and soldiers started up just at the time when
they were wanted. There was a man for every kind of work. It
is equally wonderful that men of such different characters were
all made to unite in the one object of establishing the freedom
and independence of America. There was an <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref638">overruling Providence</a>
above them.”</p>

<p>“Here was another great man,” remarked Laurence, pointing
to the portrait of John Adams.</p>

<p>“Yes; an earnest, warm-tempered, honest, and most able
man,” said Grandfather. “At the period of which we are now
speaking he was a lawyer in Boston. He was destined in after
years to be ruler over the whole American people, whom he contributed
so much to form into a nation.”</p>

<p>Grandfather here remarked that many a New Englander who
had passed his boyhood and youth in obscurity afterward attained
to a fortune which he never could have foreseen even in his most
<a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref639">ambitious dreams</a>. John Adams, the second President of the
United States and the equal of crowned kings, was once a schoolmaster
and country lawyer. Hancock, the first signer of the
Declaration of Independence, served his apprenticeship with a
merchant. Samuel Adams, afterward governor of Massachusetts,
was a small tradesman and a tax-gatherer. General Warren was
a physician, General Lincoln a farmer, and General Knox a bookbinder.
General Nathaniel Greene, the best soldier except Washington
in the Revolutionary army, was a Quaker and a blacksmith.
All these became illustrious men, and can never be forgotten
in American history.</p>

<p>“And any boy who is born in America may look forward to
the same things,” said our ambitious friend Charley.</p>

<p>After these observations Grandfather drew the book of portraits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
toward him, showed the children several British peers and
members of Parliament who had exerted themselves either for or
against the rights of America. There were the Earl of Bute,
Mr. Grenville, and Lord North. These were looked upon as
deadly enemies to our country.</p>

<p>Among the friends of America was Mr. Pitt, afterward Earl
of Chatham, who spent so much of his wondrous eloquence in
endeavoring to warn England of the consequences of her injustice.
He fell down on the floor of the House of Lords after uttering
his almost dying words in defense of our privileges as freemen.
There was Edmund Burke, one of the wisest men and greatest
orators that ever the world produced. There was Colonel
Barré, who had been among our fathers, and knew that they had
courage enough to die for their rights. There was Charles James
Fox, who never rested until he had silenced our enemies in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>“It is very remarkable to observe how many of the ablest
orators in the British Parliament were favorable to America,”
said Grandfather. “We ought to remember these great Englishmen
with gratitude, for their speeches encouraged our fathers
almost as much as those of our own orators in Faneuil Hall and
under Liberty Tree. Opinions which might have been received
with doubt if expressed only by a native American were set down
as true beyond dispute when they came from the lips of Chatham,
Burke, Barré, or Fox.”</p>

<p>“But, Grandfather,” asked Laurence, “were there no able and
eloquent men in this country who took the part of King George?”</p>

<p>“There were many men of talent who said what they could in
defense of the King’s <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref640">tyrannical proceedings</a>,” replied Grandfather,
“but they had the worst side of the argument, and therefore
seldom said anything worth remembering. Moreover, their
hearts were faint and feeble, for they felt that the people scorned
and detested them. They had no friends, no defense, except in the
bayonets of the British troops. A <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref641">blight fell upon all their faculties</a>
because they were contending against the rights of their
own native land.”</p>

<p>“What were the names of some of them?” inquired Charley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>“Governor Hutchinson, Chief-justice Oliver, Judge Auchmuty,
the Reverend Mather Byles, and several other clergymen
were among the most noted loyalists,” answered Grandfather.</p>

<p>“I wish the people had tarred and feathered every man of
them!” cried Charley.</p>

<p>“That wish is very wrong, Charley,” said Grandfather. “You
must not think that there was no integrity and honor except
among those who stood up for the freedom of America. For aught
I know, there was quite as much of these qualities on one side
as on the other. Do you see nothing admirable in a <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref642">faithful
adherence</a> to an unpopular cause? Can you not respect that <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref643">principle
of loyalty</a> which made the royalists give up country, friends,
fortune, everything, rather than be false to their king? It was a
mistaken principle, but many of them cherished it honorably and
were martyrs to it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was wrong,” said Charley, ingenuously. “And I would
risk my life rather than one of those good old royalists should be
tarred and feathered.”</p>

<p>“The time is now come when we may judge fairly of them,”
continued Grandfather. “Be the good and true men among them
honored, for they were as much our countrymen as the patriots
were. And, thank Heaven! our country need not be ashamed of
her sons—of most of them at least—whatever side they took in
the Revolutionary contest.”</p>

<p>Among the portraits was one of King George III. Little Alice
clapped her hands and seemed pleased with the <a href="#phrases60" title="List of phrases" id="ref644">bluff good nature
of his physiognomy</a>. But Laurence thought it strange that a man
with such a face, indicating hardly a common share of intellect,
should have had influence enough on human affairs to convulse
the world with war. Grandfather observed that this poor king
had always appeared to him one of the most unfortunate persons
that ever lived. He was so honest and conscientious that if he
had been only a private man his life would probably have been
blameless and happy. But his was that worst of fortunes—to be
placed in a station far beyond his abilities.</p>

<p>“And so,” said Grandfather, “his life, while he retained what
intellect Heaven had gifted him with, was one long mortification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
At last he grew crazed with care and trouble. For nearly twenty
years the monarch of England was confined as a madman. In his
old age, too, God took away his eyesight, so that his royal palace
was nothing to him but a dark, lonesome prison-house.”</p>

<h4>THE GRAY CHAMPION</h4>

<p class="author">NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</p>

<p>There was once a time when New England groaned under the
actual pressure of heavier wrongs than those threatened ones
which brought on the Revolution. James II, the bigoted successor
of Charles the Voluptuous, had annulled the charters of all
the colonies, and sent a harsh and unprincipled soldier to take
away our liberties and endanger our religion. The administration
of Sir Edmund Andros lacked scarcely a single characteristic
of tyranny: a Governor and Council, holding office from the King,
and wholly independent of the Country; laws made and taxes
levied without concurrence of the people, immediate or by their
representatives; the rights of private citizens violated, and the
titles of all landed property declared void; the voice of complaint
stifled by restrictions on the press; and, finally, disaffection overawed
by the first band of <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref645">mercenary troops</a> that ever marched on
our free soil. For two years our ancestors were kept in sullen
submission by that <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref646">filial love</a> which had invariably secured their
allegiance to the mother country, whether its head chanced
to be a Parliament, Protector, or Monarch. Till these evil
times, however, such <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref647">allegiance had been merely nominal</a>, and the
colonists had ruled themselves, enjoying far more freedom than
even yet the privilege of the native subjects of Great Britain.</p>

<p>At length a rumor reached our shores that the Prince of Orange
had ventured on an enterprise the success of which would be the
triumph of <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref648">civil and religious rights</a> and the salvation of New
England. It was but a doubtful whisper; it might be false, or
the attempt might fail; and, in either case, the man that stirred
against King James would lose his head. Still, the intelligence
produced a marked effect. The people smiled mysteriously in the
streets, and threw bold glances at their oppressors; while, far and
wide, there was a subdued and silent agitation, as if the slightest
signal would rouse the whole land from its <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref649">sluggish despondency</a>.
Aware of their danger, the rulers resolved to avert it by an imposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
display of strength, and perhaps to confirm their despotism by
yet harsher measures. One afternoon in April, 1689, Sir Edmund
Andros and his favorite councilors, being warm with wine, assembled
the red-coats of the Governors’ Guard, and made their
appearance in the streets of Boston. The sun was near setting
when the march commenced.</p>

<p>The roll of the drum, at that unquiet crisis, seemed to go
through the streets, less as the martial music of the soldiers, than
as a muster-call to the inhabitants themselves. A multitude, by
various avenues, assembled in King Street, which was destined to
be the scene, nearly a century afterwards, of another encounter
between the troops of Britain and a people struggling against her
tyranny. Though more than sixty years had elapsed since the
Pilgrims came, this crowd of their descendants still showed the
strong and somber features of their character, perhaps more strikingly
in such a stern emergency than on happier occasions. There
was the sober garb, the general <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref650">severity of mien</a>, the gloomy but
undismayed expression, the Scriptural forms of speech, and the
confidence in Heaven’s blessing on a righteous cause, which would
have marked a band of the original Puritans, when threatened
by some peril of the wilderness. Indeed, it was not yet time for
the old spirit to be extinct; since there were men in the street, that
day, who had worshiped there beneath the trees, before a house
was reared to the God for whom they had become exiles. Old soldiers
of the Parliament were here, too, smiling grimly at the
thought that their aged arms might strike another blow against
the house of Stuart. Here, also, were the veterans of King Philip’s
war, who had burned villages and slaughtered young and old, with
pious fierceness, while the godly souls throughout the land were
helping them with prayer. Several ministers were scattered among
the crowd, which, unlike all other mobs, regarded them with such
reverence as if there were sanctity in their very garments. These
holy men exerted their influence to quiet the people, but not to
disperse them. Meantime, the purpose of the Governor, in disturbing
the peace of the town, at a period when the slightest commotion
might throw the country into a ferment, was almost the
universal subject of inquiry, and variously explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>“Satan will strike his master-stroke presently,” cried some,
“because he knoweth that his time is short. All our godly pastors
are to be dragged to prison! We shall see them at a Smithfield fire
in King Street!”</p>

<p>Hereupon the people of each parish gathered closer round their
minister, who looked calmly upwards and assumed a more <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref651">apostolic
dignity</a>, as well befitted a candidate for the highest honor
of his profession, the crown of martyrdom. It was actually fancied,
at that period, that New England might have a John Rogers
of her own, to take the place of that worthy in the Primer.</p>

<p>“We are to be massacred, both man and male child!” cried
others.</p>

<p>Neither was this rumor wholly discredited, although the
wiser class believed the Governor’s object somewhat less atrocious.
His predecessor under the old charter, Bradstreet, a venerable
companion of the first settlers, was known to be in town.
There were grounds for conjecturing that Sir Edmund Andros
intended, at once, to strike terror, by a parade of military force,
and to <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref652">confound the opposite faction</a> by possessing himself of
their chief.</p>

<p>“Stand firm for the old charter, Governor!” shouted the crowd,
seizing upon the idea. “The good old Governor Bradstreet!”</p>

<p>While this cry was at the loudest, the people were surprised
by the well-known figure of Governor Bradstreet himself, a patriarch
of nearly ninety, who appeared on the elevated steps of a
door, and, with characteristic mildness, besought them to submit
to the constituted authorities.</p>

<p>“My children,” concluded this venerable person, “do nothing
rashly. Cry not aloud, but pray for the welfare of New England,
and expect patiently what the Lord will do in this matter!”</p>

<p>The event was soon to be decided. All this time the roll of the
drum had been approaching through Cornhill, louder and deeper,
till with reverberations from house to house, and the regular tramp
of martial footsteps, it burst into the street. A double rank of
soldiers made their appearance, occupying the whole breadth of
the passage, with shouldered matchlocks, and matches burning,
so as to present a row of fires in the dusk. Their steady march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
was like the progress of a machine, that would roll irresistibly
over everything in its way. Next, moving slowly, with a confused
clatter of hoofs on the pavement, rode a party of mounted gentlemen,
the central figure being Sir Edmund Andros, elderly, but
erect and soldier-like. Those around him were his favorite councilors,
and the bitterest foes of New England. At his right hand
rode Edward Randolph, our arch-enemy, that “blasted wretch,”
as Cotton Mather calls him, who achieved the downfall of our
ancient government, and was followed with a sensible curse,
through life and to his grave. On the other side was Bullivant,
scattering jests and mockery as he rode along. Dudley came behind,
with a downcast look, dreading, as well he might, to meet the
indignant gaze of the people, who beheld him, their only countryman
by birth, among the oppressors of his native land. The captain
of a frigate in the harbor, and two or three civil officers under
the Crown, were also there. But the figure which most attracted
the public eye, and stirred up the deepest feeling, was the Episcopal
clergyman of King’s Chapel, riding haughtily among the
magistrates in his priestly vestments, the fitting representative of
<a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref653">prelacy and persecution</a>, the union of Church and State, and all
those abominations which had driven the Puritans to the wilderness.
Another guard of soldiers, in double rank, brought up the
rear.</p>

<p>The whole scene was a picture of the condition of New England,
and its moral, the deformity of any government that does
not grow out of the nature of things and the character of the
people. On one side the religious multitude, with their sad visages
and dark attire, and on the other, the group of despotic rulers,
with the High-Churchman in the midst, and here and there a
crucifix at their bosoms, all magnificently clad, flushed with wine,
proud of unjust authority, and scoffing at the universal groan.
And the mercenary soldiers, waiting but the word to deluge the
street with blood, showed the only means by which obedience
could be secured.</p>

<p>“O Lord of Hosts,” cried a voice among the crowd, “provide a
Champion for thy people!”</p>

<p>This ejaculation was loudly uttered, and served as a herald’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
cry, to introduce a remarkable personage. The crowd had rolled
back, and were now huddled together nearly at the extremity of
the street, while the soldiers had advanced no more than a third
of its length. The intervening space was empty—a paved solitude,
between lofty edifices, which threw almost a twilight shadow
over it. Suddenly, there was seen the figure of an ancient man,
who seemed to have emerged from among the people, and was
walking by himself along the center of the street, to confront the
armed band. He wore the old Puritan dress, a dark cloak and a
steeple-crowned hat, in the fashion of at least fifty years before,
with a heavy sword upon his thigh, but a staff in his hand to
assist the tremulous gait of age.</p>

<p>When at some distance from the multitude, the old man turned
slowly round, displaying a face of antique majesty, rendered
doubly venerable by the hoary beard that descended on his breast.
He made a gesture at once of encouragement and warning, then
turned again, and resumed his way.</p>

<p>“Who is this gray patriarch?” asked the young men of their
sires.</p>

<p>“Who is this venerable brother?” asked the old men among
themselves.</p>

<p>But none could make reply. The fathers of the people, those
of fourscore years and upwards, were disturbed, deeming it
strange that they should forget one of such evident authority,
whom they must have known in their early days, the associate
of Winthrop, and all the old councilors, giving laws, and making
prayers, and leading them against the savage. The elderly men
ought to have remembered him, too, with locks as gray in their
youth as their own were now. And the young! How could he
have passed so utterly from their memories—that hoary sire, the
relic of long-departed times, whose awful benediction had surely
been bestowed on their uncovered heads, in childhood?</p>

<p>“Whence did he come? What is his purpose? Who can this
old man be?” whispered the wondering crowd.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the venerable stranger, staff in hand, was pursuing
his solitary walk along the center of the street. As he drew
near the advancing soldiers, and as the roll of their drum came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
full upon his ear, the old man raised himself to a loftier mien,
while the decrepitude of age seemed to fall from his shoulders,
leaving him in gray but unbroken dignity. Now, he marched
onward with a warrior’s step, keeping time to the military music.
Thus the aged form advanced on one side, and the whole parade
of soldiers and magistrates on the other, till, when scarcely twenty
yards remained between, the old man grasped his staff by the
middle, and held it before him like a <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref654">leader’s truncheon</a>.</p>

<p>“Stand!” cried he.</p>

<p>The eye, the face, and attitude of command, the solemn, yet
warlike peal of that voice, fit either to rule a host in the battlefield
or be raised to God in prayer, were irresistible. At the old
man’s word and outstretched arm, the roll of the drum was hushed
at once, and the advancing line stood still. A tremulous enthusiasm
seized upon the multitude. That stately form, combining
the leader and the saint, so gray, so dimly seen, in such an ancient
garb, could only belong to some old champion of the righteous
cause, whom the oppressor’s drum had summoned from his grave.
They raised a shout of awe and exultation, and looked for the
deliverance of New England.</p>

<p>The Governor, and the gentlemen of his party, perceiving
themselves brought to an unexpected stand, rode hastily forward,
as if they would have pressed their snorting and affrighted horses
right against the <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref655">hoary apparition</a>. He, however, blenched not a
step, but glancing his severe eye round the group, which <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref656">half
encompassed</a> him, at last bent it sternly on Sir Edmund Andros.
One would have thought that the dark old man was chief ruler
there, and that the Governor and Council, with soldiers at their
back, representing the whole power and authority of the Crown,
had no alternative but obedience.</p>

<p>“What does this old fellow here?” cried Edward Randolph,
fiercely. “On, Sir Edmund! Bid the soldiers forward, and give
the dotard the same choice that you give all his countrymen—to
stand aside or be trampled on!”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, let us show respect to the good grandsire,” said
Bullivant, laughing. “See you not, he is some old <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref657">roundheaded
dignitary</a>, who hath lain asleep these thirty years, and knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
nothing of the change of times? Doubtless, he thinks to put us
down with a proclamation in Old Noll’s name!”</p>

<p>“Are you mad, old man?” demanded Sir Edmund Andros, in
loud and harsh tones. “How dare you stay the march of King
James’s Governor?”</p>

<p>“I have stayed the march of a king himself, ere now,” replied
the gray figure, with stern composure. “I am here, Sir Governor,
because the cry of an oppressed people hath disturbed me in my
secret place; and beseeching this favor earnestly of the Lord, it
was vouchsafed me to appear once again on earth, in the good old
cause of his saints. And what speak ye of James? There is no
longer a tyrant on the throne of England, and by tomorrow
noon his name shall be a byword in this very street, where
ye would make it a word of terror. Back, thou that wast a Governor,
back! With this night thy power is ended—tomorrow, the
prison!—back, lest I foretell the scaffold!”</p>

<p>The people had been drawing nearer and nearer, and drinking
in the words of their champion, who spoke in accents long disused,
like one unaccustomed to converse, except with the dead
of many years ago. But his voice stirred their souls. They confronted
the soldiers, not wholly without arms, and ready to convert
the very stones of the street into deadly weapons. Sir
Edmund Andros looked at the old man; then he cast his hard and
cruel eye over the multitude, and beheld them burning with that
<a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref658">lurid wrath</a>, so difficult to kindle or to quench; and again he fixed
his gaze on the aged form, which stood obscurely in an open space,
where neither friend nor foe had thrust himself. What were his
thoughts, he uttered no word which might discover. But whether
the oppressor were overawed by the Gray Champion’s look, or
perceived his peril in the threatening attitude of the people, it is
certain that he gave back, and ordered his soldiers to commence
a slow and guarded retreat. Before another sunset, the Governor,
and all that rode so proudly with him, were prisoners, and long
ere it was known that James had abdicated, King William was
proclaimed throughout New England.</p>

<p>But where was the Gray Champion? Some reported, that
when the troops had gone from King Street, and the people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
thronging tumultuously in their rear, Bradstreet, the aged Governor,
was seen to embrace a form more aged than his own. Others
soberly affirmed, that while they marveled at the venerable
grandeur of his aspect, the old man had faded from their eyes,
melting slowly into the hues of twilight, till, where he stood, there
was an empty space. But all agreed that the hoary shape was
gone. The men of that generation watched for his reappearance,
in sunshine and in twilight, but never saw him more, nor knew
when his funeral passed, nor where his gravestone was.</p>

<p>And who was the Gray Champion? Perhaps his name might
be found in the records of that stern Court of Justice which
passed a sentence, too mighty for the age, but glorious in all after
times, for its humbling lesson to the monarch and its high example
to the subject. I have heard, that whenever the descendants of
the Puritans are to show the spirit of their sires, the old man
appears again. When eighty years had passed, he walked once
more in King Street. Five years later, in the twilight of an April
morning, he stood on the green, beside the meeting-house, at Lexington,
where now the <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref659">obelisk of granite</a>, with a slab of slate
inlaid, commemorates the first fallen of the Revolution. And
when our fathers were toiling at the breastwork on Bunker’s Hill,
all through that night the old warrior walked his rounds. Long,
long may it be, ere he comes again! His hour is one of darkness,
and adversity, and peril. But should domestic tyranny oppress
us, or the invader’s step pollute our soil, still may the Gray
Champion come, for he is the type of New England’s hereditary
spirit, and his shadowy march, on the eve of danger, must ever
be the pledge that New England’s sons will <a href="#phrases61" title="List of phrases" id="ref660">vindicate their
ancestry</a>.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> A tradition handed down from the time of King
Philip’s war gave Hawthorne the suggestion for this story. In the attack
made upon the village of Hadley, Massachusetts, by the Indians in 1675 a
venerable man, of stately form, and with flowing white beard, suddenly
appeared among the panic-stricken villagers, took command, and helped
them put the savages to flight. Then he disappeared as suddenly as he
had come. In their wonder, not knowing where he had come from or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
where he had gone, many believed he had been sent from Heaven to
deliver them.</p>

<p>Their defender was William Goffe, who had been an officer in Cromwell’s
army, and a member of the court which condemned Charles I to
death. (Read the reference to this court in the story.) He was a Puritan,
a man of deep religious feeling, whose acts had been governed by the
desire to secure his countrymen their liberties. When Charles II succeeded
to the English throne, Goffe fled to New England to escape his
vengeance. Officers were sent across the ocean in pursuit of him. For
this reason he lived in hiding, his name and identity being known only
to friends who aided and protected him. He had many narrow escapes,
but was never captured. From his hiding place he had seen the Indians
stealing upon the people of Hadley and had gone forth to battle against
them. After living in exile for the rest of his life, he died about 1679.</p>

<p>In this story Hawthorne altered facts to suit his purpose, making the
Gray Champion appear at the time of the Boston Insurrection, in 1689.
In this year James II, who had succeeded his brother, Charles II, was
dethroned, and fled from his kingdom, and his son-in-law, William III,
Prince of Orange, was made King of England.</p>

<p>The Gray Champion is made to typify the Spirit of Liberty—that
spirit which animated Goffe as a Puritan soldier under Cromwell and which
sent the Pilgrims and Puritans forth to find a home in the New World.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Read that part of the story which pictures the conditions
of New England under Andros. 2. What were the wrongs under
which the people suffered? 3. Did they submit willingly? 4. What rumor
gave them hope of a return of “civil and religious rights”? 5. How did this
rumor affect the Governor and his councilors? 6. Why was the Guard
assembled? 7. What effect upon the people had its appearance at this
time? 8. What does Hawthorne call this scene in the street? 9. What
does he say is its “moral”? 10. Who came to have the advantage, the
Governor and his soldiers, or the people? 11. Read all that accounts for
the Champion and his sudden appearance. 12. What great cause did he
come to champion? 13. What cause were Andros and his soldiers supporting?
14. Who was victorious? 15. Tell briefly the main incident.
16. Give your opinion as to Hawthorne’s purpose in writing this story.</p>

<h4>LIBERTY OR DEATH</h4>

<p class="author">PATRICK HENRY</p>

<p>Mr. President,—No man thinks more highly than I do of the
patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who
have just addressed the House. But different men often see the
same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not
be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen, if, entertaining, as I
do, opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak
forth my sentiments freely and without reserve. This is no time
for ceremony. The question before the House is one <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref667">of awful
moment</a> to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion
to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the
debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth,
and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our
country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through
fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason
toward my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the
Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.</p>

<p>Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref668">illusions
of hope</a>. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and
listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts.
Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref669">arduous struggle</a>
for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who,
having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear not, the things which
so nearly concern their <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref670">temporal salvation</a>? For my part, whatever
<a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref671">anguish of spirit</a> it may cost, I am willing to know the whole
truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.</p>

<p>I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is
the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future
but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what
there has been in the conduct of the British Ministry for the last
ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been
pleased to solace themselves and the House? Is it that <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref672">insidious
smile</a> with which our petition has been lately received? Trust it
not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves
to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious
reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations
which cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and
armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we
shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be
called in to win back our love? Let us not deceive ourselves, sir.
These are the <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref673">implements of war</a> and subjugation—the last arguments
to which kings resort. I ask, sir, what means this <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref674">martial
array</a>, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen
assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain
any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are
meant for us; they can be meant for no other. They are sent over
to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British Ministry
have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them?
Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last
ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject?
Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it
is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty
and humble supplication? What terms shall we find, which have
not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir,
deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything that could
be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have
petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have
prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its
interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the Ministry and
Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances
have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications
have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt,
from the foot of the throne! In vain, after these things, may we
indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no
longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean to
<a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref675">preserve inviolate</a> those <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref676">inestimable privileges</a> for which we have
been so long contending—if we mean not basely to abandon the
noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which
we have pledged ourselves never to abandon, until the glorious
object of our contest shall be attained—we must fight! I repeat
it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of Hosts
is all that is left us!</p>

<p>They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref677">cope with so
formidable</a> an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will
it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are
totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in
every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and inaction?
Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying
<a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref678">supinely on our backs</a> and hugging the <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref679">delusive phantom</a> of hope
until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?</p>

<p>Sir, we are not weak, if we make a proper use of those means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
which the God of nature hath placed in our power. Three millions
of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country
as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our
enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our
battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies
of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for
us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant,
the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we
were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the
contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our
chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains
of Boston! The war is inevitable—and let it come! I repeat it,
sir, let it come!</p>

<p>It is in vain, sir, to <a href="#phrases63" title="List of phrases" id="ref680">extenuate the matter</a>. Gentlemen may cry,
Peace, peace!—but there is no peace. The war is actually begun!
The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears
the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the
field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish?
What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to
be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take; but as for
me, give me liberty or give me death!</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> Patrick Henry (1736-1799) delivered this speech at
the Virginia Convention, March 28, 1775. For some years this fiery young
orator had been active in Virginia in stirring up resistance to the tyrannical
acts of the King. In 1774 the royal governor in that colony reported that
every county was arming a company of men for the purpose of protecting
their committees, which had been formed, as in the other colonies, to work
out a plan of coöperation against the British government. In March, 1775,
the second revolutionary convention of Virginia met at Richmond. A resolution
was offered to put the colony into a state of defense. Some delegates
objected to such radical action, and it is to these men that Henry addressed
the opening sentences of his speech.</p>

<p>The resolution was adopted. The chief command of the Virginia
forces was offered to Colonel Washington, who accepted with the words,
“It is my full intention to devote my life and fortune to the cause in which
we are engaged.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. From reading the first paragraph, what idea do you
get of Patrick Henry as an opponent? 2. Do you think Patrick Henry
expresses a truth for all time when he says, “In proportion to the magnitude
of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate”? 3. Find, in your
history, the chief acts of the British Ministry for the ten years prior to
1775. 4. What are the arguments which Patrick Henry uses to convince
the delegates of the need of immediate action? 5. What did the next gale
sweeping from the north bring to their ears? 6. Notice Patrick Henry’s
use of figurative language throughout this speech. 7. Pronounce the following:
siren; illusion; arduous; solace; insidious; inestimable; formidable.</p>

<h4>GEORGE WASHINGTON TO HIS WIFE</h4>

<p class="right">Philadelphia, 18 June, 1775</p>

<p class="noindent">My Dearest:</p>

<p>I am now set down to write to you on a subject
which fills me with <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref681">inexpressible concern</a>, and this concern is
greatly aggravated and increased when I reflect upon the uneasiness
I know it will give you. It has been determined in Congress
that the whole army raised for the defense of the American cause
shall be put under my care, and that it is necessary for me to
proceed immediately to Boston to take upon me the command
of it.</p>

<p>You may believe me, my dear Patsy, when I assure you, in
the most solemn manner, that, so far from seeking this appointment,
I have used every endeavor in my power to avoid it, not
only from my unwillingness to part with you and the family, but
from a <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref682">consciousness of its being a trust</a> <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref683">too great for my capacity</a>,
and that I should enjoy more real happiness in one month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
with you at home, than I have the most <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref684">distant prospect</a> of finding
abroad, if my stay were to be seven times seven years. But
as it has been a kind of destiny that has thrown me upon this
service, I shall hope that my undertaking it is designed to answer
some good purpose. You might, and I suppose did <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref685">perceive, from
the tenor</a> of my letters, that I was apprehensive I could not avoid
this appointment, as I did not pretend to intimate when I should
return. That was the case. It was utterly out of my power to
refuse this appointment, without <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref686">exposing my character to such
censures</a> as would have reflected dishonor upon myself and given
pain to my friends. This, I am sure, could not, and ought not,
to be pleasing to you, and must have lessened me considerably in
my own esteem. I shall rely, therefore, confidently on that Providence
which has heretofore preserved and been bountiful to me,
not doubting but that I shall return safe to you in the fall. I shall
feel no pain from the toil or the danger of the campaign; my unhappiness
will flow from the uneasiness I know you will feel from
being left alone. I therefore beg that you will <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref687">summon your
whole fortitude</a> and pass your time as agreeably as possible.
Nothing will give me so much sincere satisfaction as to hear this,
and to hear it from your own pen. My earnest and <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref688">ardent desire</a>
is that you would pursue any plan that is most likely to produce
content and a <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref689">tolerable degree of tranquillity</a>; as it must add
greatly to my uneasy feelings to hear that you are dissatisfied or
complaining at what I really could not avoid.</p>

<p>As life is always uncertain and common <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref690">prudence dictates</a> to
every man the necessity of settling his <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref691">temporal concerns</a> while
it is in his power, and while the mind is calm and undisturbed, I
have, since I came to this place (for I had not time to do it before
I left home), got Colonel Pendleton to draft a will for me, by
the directions I gave him, which will I now enclose. The provision
made for you in case of my death will, I hope, be agreeable.</p>

<p>I shall add nothing more, as I have several letters to write, but
to desire that you will remember me to your friends, and to assure
you that I am with the most <a href="#phrases64" title="List of phrases" id="ref692">unfeigned regard</a>, my dear Patsy,
your affectionate, &amp;c.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> George Washington (1732-1799) came from Virginia
to attend the second meeting of the Continental Congress held in Philadelphia
May 10, 1775. He was at that time commander of the militia of
Virginia and sat in Congress in his colonel’s uniform. In the name of “The
United Colonies” the Congress voted to authorize the enlistment of troops,
to build and garrison forts, and to issue notes to the amount of three million
dollars, the original “Liberty Loan” in America. There was an army
of about ten thousand men encamped around Boston and these Congress
adopted as “The Continental Army.” John Adams rose in his place and
proposed the name of the Virginian, George Washington, to be commander-in-chief
of this New England army. “The gentleman,” he said, “is among
us and is very well known to us all; a gentleman whose skill and experience
as an officer, whose independent fortune, great talents, and excellent
universal character would command the approbation of all America,
and unite the cordial exertions of all the colonies better than any other
person in the Union.” The pay of the commander-in-chief was fixed at
five hundred dollars a month and on June 15 Washington received the
unanimous vote for this all-important office. His lofty stature, exceeding
six feet, his grave and handsome face, his noble bearing and courtly grace
of manner all proclaimed him worthy of the honor. In a brief speech
expressive of his high sense of the honor conferred upon him, he said,
“I beg it may be remembered by every gentleman in this room, that I this
day declare, with the utmost sincerity, that I do not think myself equal to
the command I am honored with. As to pay, I beg leave to assure the
Congress that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to
accept this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic ease and
happiness, I do not wish to make any profit of it. I will keep an exact
account of my expenses. Those, I doubt not, they will discharge; and that
is all I desire.”</p>

<p>As there was no time for a visit to his home, Mt. Vernon, on the
Potomac River, Washington was obliged to give his wife this important
information by letter. (In 1759 Washington had married Mrs. Martha
Custis, the widow of one of the wealthiest planters in the Virginia Colony.
She had two beautiful children at the time of her marriage, but when
Washington went north to Philadelphia Mrs. Washington was quite alone,
for her son was away from home and her daughter had died a few years
before.) Later in the year Mrs. Washington went north and spent the
winter with her husband at Craigie house, the army headquarters in
Cambridge.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Name the fine qualities of Washington shown in this
letter. 2. Read the sentence that tells briefly what has happened. 3. What
do you imagine was Mrs. Washington’s reply to this letter?</p>

<h4>GEORGE WASHINGTON TO GOVERNOR GEORGE CLINTON</h4>

<p class="right">Valley Forge, 16 February, 1778</p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Sir:</p>

<p>It is with great reluctance I trouble you on a subject
which does not properly <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref693">fall within your province</a>; but it is
a subject that occasions me more distress than I have felt since
the commencement of the war; and which loudly demands the
most <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref694">zealous exertions</a> of every person of weight and authority,
who is interested in the success of our affairs; I mean the present
dreadful situation of the army, for want of provision, and the
miserable prospects before us, with <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref695">respect to futurity</a>. It is more
alarming than you will probably conceive; for, to form a just
idea of it, it were necessary to be on the spot. For some days
past, there has been little less than a famine in camp. A part of
the army has been a week without any kind of flesh, and the rest
three or four days. Naked and starving as they are, we cannot
enough admire the <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref696">incomparable patience</a> and fidelity of the soldiery,
that they have not been, ere this, <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref697">excited by their suffering
to a general mutiny and dispersion</a>. Strong <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref698">symptoms, however,
of discontent</a> have appeared in particular instances; and nothing
but the most active efforts, everywhere, can long <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref699">avert so shocking
a catastrophe</a>.</p>

<p>Our present sufferings are not all. There is no foundation laid
for any <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref700">adequate relief hereafter</a>. All <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref701">the magazines provided</a>
in the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
and all the immediate additional supplies they seem capable
of affording, will not be sufficient to support the army more than
a month longer, if so long. Very little has been done at the eastward,
and as little to the southward; and whatever we have a right
to expect from those quarters must necessarily be very remote,
and is, indeed, more precarious than could be wished. When the
before-mentioned supplies are exhausted, what a terrible <a href="#phrases65" title="List of phrases" id="ref702">crisis
must ensue</a>, unless all the energy of the Continent shall be exerted
to provide a timely remedy!</p>

<p>I am etc.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> This letter was addressed to George Clinton, governor
of New York from 1777-1795. Washington appealed to Clinton
because of the abilities and resources of New York and also because the
governor’s zeal as a patriot was well known. At the same time Washington
addressed a similar letter to the inhabitants of New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, urging the farmers to provide
cattle for the use of the army. He assures them of a bountiful price as
well as the knowledge that they have rendered most essential service to
the illustrious cause of their country.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Read in your history text what is said about the winter
of 1777-1778 at Valley Forge. 2. How do the methods of conserving food
for the army in Washington’s time compare with those of our own time?
3. How does Washington hope to avert a terrible crisis? 4. Pronounce the
following: incomparable; catastrophe; adequate; precarious.</p>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> General Francis Marion was a general of the Revolutionary
period. He was a leader of a band of men who worried the
victorious British troops in the Carolinas in 1780 and 1781 and assisted in
driving Cornwallis north, where he surrendered at Yorktown in 1781. Marion
and his men in their greenwood fortress remind us of Robin Hood and

<h4>TIMES THAT TRY MEN’S SOULS</h4>

<p class="author">THOMAS PAINE</p>

<p>These are the times that try men’s souls. The <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref715">summer soldier</a>
and the <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref716">sunshine patriot</a> will, in this crisis, shrink from the service
of his country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and
thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered;
yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the
conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too
cheap, we esteem too lightly; ’tis dearness only that gives everything
its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon
its goods; it would be strange indeed, if so <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref717">celestial an article</a> as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
freedom should not be highly rated. Britain, with an army to
enforce her tyranny, has declared that she has a right, not only
to tax, but to “bind us in all cases whatsoever,” and if being
bound in that manner is not slavery, then is there not such a
thing as slavery upon earth. Even the <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref718">expression is impious</a>, for
so unlimited a power can belong only to God.</p>

<p>I have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my
secret opinion has been, and still is, that God Almighty will not
give up a people to military destruction, or leave them <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref719">unsupportedly
to perish</a>, who have so earnestly and so repeatedly
sought to avoid the <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref720">calamities of war</a>, by every decent method
which wisdom could invent.</p>

<p>I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel,
against the mean principles that are held by the tories: a noted
one, who kept a tavern at Amboy, was standing at his door, with
as pretty a child in his hand, about eight or nine years old, as I
ever saw, and after speaking his mind as freely as he thought
was prudent, finished with this unfatherly expression, “Well!
give me peace in my day.” Not a man lives on the continent but
fully believes that a separation must some time or other finally
take place, and a generous parent should have said, “If there
must be trouble, let it be in my day, that my child may have
peace”; and his <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref721">single reflection</a>, well applied, is sufficient to
awaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be
so happy as America. Her situation is remote from all the
wrangling world, and she has nothing to do but to trade with
them. A man can distinguish in himself between temper and
principle, and I am as confident, as I am that God governs the
world, that America will never be happy till she gets clear of
<a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref722">foreign dominion</a>. Wars, without ceasing, will break out till
that period arrives, and the continent must in the end be conqueror;
for though the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to
shine, the coal can never expire.</p>

<p>The heart that feels not now, is dead; the blood of his children
will curse his cowardice, who shrinks back at a time when a little
might have saved the whole, and made them happy. I love the
man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
distress, and grow brave by reflection. ’Tis the business of little
minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience
approves his conduct, will <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref723">pursue his principles</a> unto death. My
own line of reasoning is to myself as straight and clear as a ray
of light. Not all the treasures of the world, so far as I believe,
could have induced me to support an <a href="#phrases67" title="List of phrases" id="ref724">offensive war</a>, for I think it
murder; but if a thief breaks into my house, burns and destroys
my property, and kills or threatens to kill me, or those that are
in it, and to “bind me in all cases whatsoever” to his absolute
will, am I to suffer it? What signifies it to me, whether he who
does it is a king or a common man; my countryman or not my
countryman; whether it be done by an individual villain, or an
army of them? If we reason to the root of things we shall find
no difference; neither can any just cause be assigned why we
should punish in the one case and pardon in the other.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> Thomas Paine (1737-1809), an interesting figure of
the Revolutionary period, did much by his writings to help win the war.
Franklin on one occasion said, “Where liberty is, there is my home.”
Whereupon Paine answered, “Where liberty is not, there is my home.”
He came to America from England in 1774 and fought for America’s freedom
as a volunteer under Washington. After the Revolution he went to
France, where again he fought for liberty in the French Revolution.</p>

<p>This selection is from a pamphlet called “The Crisis,” published in
1776 by Paine. Washington had lost the battle of Long Island and had
been compelled to retreat from New York toward Philadelphia. In Philadelphia
there were many royalists who hoped that England would win the
war. Washington’s soldiers, who had enlisted for short terms, were encouraged
to desert or to resign at the end of their terms. The situation was
serious.</p>

<p>Washington ordered that “The Crisis” be read before every company
of soldiers in his army.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Select from these paragraphs sentences that would
make good mottoes. 2. What political and military situation did Paine
have in mind in the opening sentences? 3. What do you think of the
argument of the tavern-keeper at Amboy as compared with Paine’s?
4. What do we think today of our “remoteness from the wrangling
world”? 5. What, in the last one hundred years, has brought Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
and America closer together than they were in Paine’s day? 6. Under
what conditions does Paine think war is justified?</p>

<h3 id="IV_INTRO">LITERATURE AND LIFE IN THE HOMELAND<br />
<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></h3>

<p>It is a hard thing to picture to ourselves our Homeland.
Is America just a lot of cities and towns and farms, or a collection
of so many thousands of square miles of prairies and mountains,
the sort of thing one would see from an airplane if one could
get up high enough and had good enough eyes? Or is it a collection
of states with queer boundary lines that look plainer on a map
than they do when we cross them in the train? There are people
who try to find America in some motto or symbol. One of our
great cities has for its motto the words “I will,” and the people
who live in that city like to think that the enterprise by which
they build great industries and give work to great numbers of
people is the expression of their Americanism. And some people
see in the Statue of Liberty in the New York harbor, a statue
holding aloft a blazing torch to give light to all people, the
symbol that best expresses the spirit of America.</p>

<p>Both the motto and the statue help us to see our country as
something more than a part of a book called “Geography” or
“History.” Both of them express what America had always
been to its citizens and what it became to the world in 1917.
We did not desire to enter the war, but when it became necessary
to do so no true American hesitated. There were great difficulties:
an army to raise and equip and train so that it could meet an
army that had been preparing for forty years to fight the world;
an army to be transported over three thousand miles of water, a
terrific task even in normal times, but made a hundred-fold harder
because of the monsters that lurked under the sea waiting a
chance to send a transport to the bottom. And once across, there
were docks and railroads to be built and a great industrial organization
to be set going. But the will of America was triumphant
and the job was done. And the statue, like the “I will,” is a
symbol of the spirit in America that has helped the spirit of
liberty throughout the world, so that we now know the day is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
coming when all peoples, everywhere, shall be free. We can
make a beginning, therefore, in our effort to form a picture of
what America means, by thinking of this Statue of Liberty and
of these words of high purpose, “I will.”</p>

<p>But we must fill in the picture. No statue will do, for it,
after all, is lifeless. No motto will do, for it is only a phrase,
an inscription. A photograph on which you have written a date
or the record of a happy meeting with your friend, is very interesting
indeed, and helps you to call to mind your friend. But
in reality the photograph merely suggests to you your friend
and your happy times together. Your friend has many moods,
now sad, now gay. Your friend looks different at different times.
The history of your friendship has many events in it, and all
these go together, a thousand details, to make up your own idea
“this is my friend.” So it is with America. History and legend,
the knowledge of past events, must acquaint us with our country
as with our friend. Infinite variety of mood she has, now
stern and grave like her mountains, now placid like her vast
expanse of prairie or her waving fields of grain; now laughing
like the waters in the sunlight, or beautiful in anger as mighty
storms sweep hill and plain. And infinite, again, are her activities—great
factories and mills, lofty office buildings filled with
workers, trains speeding like mighty shuttles through vast distances,
farms filled with growing food for a world. All these
you must bring into your picture, and more, for infinite, also,
are the ideals and hopes that go to make up this many-sided
personality that we name Our Country.</p>

<p>The selections that follow will help you to make this picture
that is to be more to us than a statue or a photograph. Some
of them are little views, snapshots of our nation’s childhood.
Others are pictures of various moods or appearances of the later
America. Some show the spirit of laughter in America; others
give some of the songs of America; and at the end are a few
pictures of America at work. All will help, but they are only
an imperfect and brief introduction to a subject that is going
to interest you all through your life: What is America to me,
and what can I do to make her happy?</p>

<h4>THE CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS</h4>

<p class="author">ARCHBISHOP CORRIGAN</p>

<p>To us it is given to behold in its full splendor what Columbus,
like another Moses on the borders of the Land of Promise, could
only discern in dim and distant outlines. And, therefore, with
Italy, the land of his birth; with Spain, the land of his adoption;
with the other nations of the globe who are debtors to his daring,
we gladly swell the universal chorus in his honor of praise and of
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>In 1792 the ocean separated us by a journey of seventy days
from Europe; our self-government was looked upon as a problem
still to be solved; at home, facilities of travel and of intercommunication
were yet to be provided. More than this, the <a href="#phrases68" title="List of phrases" id="ref725">unworthy
innuendoes</a>, the base as well as baseless charges that
sought to tarnish the fair fame of Columbus, had not been removed
by patient historical research and <a href="#phrases68" title="List of phrases" id="ref726">critical acumen</a>. Fortunately,
these clouds that gathered around the exploits of the
great discoverer have been almost entirely dispelled, thanks
especially to the initiative of a son of our Empire State, the
immortal Washington Irving.</p>

<p>I beg to present Columbus as a man of science and a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
faith. As a scientist, considering the time in which he lived, he
eminently deserves our respect. Both in theory and in practice
he was one of the best geographers and cosmographers of the age.
According to reliable historians, before he set out to discover new
seas, he had navigated the whole extent of those already known.
Moreover, he had studied so many authors and to such advantage
that Alexander von Humboldt affirmed: “When we consider his
life we must feel astonishment at the extent of his literary
acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Columbus took nothing for granted. While he bowed reverently
to the teachings of his faith, he brushed away as cobwebs
certain interpretations of Scripture more fanciful than real, and
calmly maintained that the Word of God cannot be in conflict
with scientific truth. The project of bearing Christ over the
waters sank deeply into his heart. Time and again he alludes to
it as the main object of his researches and the aim of his labors.
Other motives of action undoubtedly he had, but they were a
means to an end.</p>

<p>Moreover, may we not reasonably assume that the great navigator,
after all, was a willing instrument in the hands of God?
The old order was changing. Three great inventions, already
beginning to exert a most <a href="#phrases68" title="List of phrases" id="ref727">potent influence</a>, were destined to revolutionize
the world—the printing-press, which led to the revival
of learning; the use of gun-powder, which changed the methods of
warfare; the mariner’s compass, which permitted the sailor to
tempt boldly even unknown seas.</p>

<p>These three great <a href="#phrases68" title="List of phrases" id="ref728">factors of civilization</a>, each in its own way,
so stimulated human thought that the discovery of America was
plainly in the designs of that Providence which “reacheth from
end to end mightily and ordereth all things sweetly.”</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that those early writers, who treated of the
discovery and settlement of America, have not given us more particular
and candid accounts of the remarkable characters that
flourished in savage life. The scanty anecdotes which have
reached us are full of peculiarity and interest; they furnish us with
nearer glimpses of human nature, and show what man is in a comparatively
primitive state, and what he owes to civilization.
There is something of the charm of discovery in lighting upon
these wild and unexplored tracts of human nature; in witnessing,
as it were, the native growth of moral sentiment, and perceiving
those generous and romantic qualities which have been <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref735">artificially
cultivated</a> by society, <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref736">vegetating in spontaneous hardihood</a> and
rude magnificence.</p>

<p>In civilized life, where the happiness, and indeed almost the
existence, of man depends so much upon the opinion of his fellow-men,
he is constantly acting a studied part. The bold and peculiar
traits of native character are refined away, or softened down by
the leveling influence of what is termed good-breeding; and he
practices so many <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref737">petty deceptions</a>, and <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref738">affects so many generous
sentiments</a>, for the purposes of popularity, that it is difficult to
distinguish his real from his artificial character. The Indian, on
the contrary, free from the restraints and refinements of polished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
life, and, in a great degree, a solitary and independent being,
obeys the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref739">impulses of his inclination</a> or the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref740">dictates of his judgment</a>;
and thus the attributes of his nature, being freely indulged,
grow singly great and striking. Society is like a lawn, where every
roughness is smoothed, every bramble eradicated, and where the
eye is delighted by the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref741">smiling verdure</a> of a velvet surface; he,
however, who would study nature in its wildness and variety, must
plunge into the forest, must explore the glen, must stem the torrent,
and dare the precipice.</p>

<p>These reflections arose on casually looking through a volume of
early colonial history, wherein are recorded, with great bitterness,
the outrages of the Indians, and their wars with the settlers of
New England. It is painful to perceive even from these partial
narratives, how the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref742">footsteps of civilization</a> may be traced in the
blood of the aborigines; how easily the colonists were moved to
hostility by the lust of conquest; how merciless and exterminating
was their warfare. The imagination shrinks at the idea, how
many intellectual beings were hunted from the earth, how many
brave and noble hearts, of nature’s <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref743">sterling coinage</a>, were broken
down and trampled in the dust!</p>

<p>Such was the fate of Philip of Pokanoket, an Indian warrior,
whose name was once a terror throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut.
He was the most distinguished of a number of contemporary
Sachems who reigned over the Pequods, the Narragansets,
the Wampanoags, and the other eastern tribes, at the time of the
first settlement of New England; a band of native untaught
heroes, who made the most generous struggle of which human
nature is capable; fighting to the last gasp in the cause of their
country, without a hope of victory or a thought of renown.
Worthy of an age of poetry, and fit subjects for local story and
romantic fiction, they have left scarcely <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref744">any authentic traces</a> on
the page of history, but stalk, like gigantic shadows, in the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref745">dim
twilight of tradition</a>.</p>

<p>When the pilgrims, as the Plymouth settlers are called by
their descendants, first took refuge on the shores of the New
World, from the religious persecutions of the Old, their situation
was to the last degree gloomy and disheartening. Few in number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
and that number rapidly perishing away through sickness
and hardships; surrounded by a howling wilderness and savage
tribes; exposed to the rigors of an almost arctic winter, and the
vicissitudes of an ever-shifting climate; their minds were filled
with <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref746">doleful forebodings</a>, and nothing preserved them from sinking
into despondency but the strong excitement of religious enthusiasm.
In this forlorn situation they were visited by Massasoit,
chief Sagamore of the Wampanoags, a powerful chief, who reigned
over a great extent of country. Instead of taking advantage of
the scanty number of the strangers, and expelling them from his
territories, into which they had intruded, he seemed at once to
conceive for them a generous friendship, and extended toward
them the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref747">rites of primitive hospitality</a>. He came early in the
spring to their settlement of New Plymouth, attended by a mere
handful of followers, entered into a solemn league of peace and
amity; sold them a portion of the soil, and promised to secure for
them the good-will of his savage allies. Whatever may be said of
Indian perfidy, it is certain that the integrity and good faith of
Massasoit have never been impeached. He continued a firm and
magnanimous friend of the white men; suffering them to extend
their possessions, and to strengthen themselves in the land; and
betraying no jealousy of their increasing power and prosperity.
Shortly before his death he came once more to New Plymouth,
with his son Alexander, for the purpose of renewing the covenant
of peace, and of securing it to his posterity.</p>

<p>At this conference he endeavored to protect the religion of his
forefathers from the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref748">encroaching zeal</a> of the missionaries; and
stipulated that no further attempt should be made to draw off his
people from their ancient faith; but, finding the English obstinately
opposed to any such condition, he mildly relinquished
the demand. Almost the last act of his life was to bring his two
sons, Alexander and Philip (as they had been named by the English),
to the residence of a principal settler, recommending mutual
kindness and confidence; and entreating that the same love and
amity which had existed between the white men and himself
might be continued afterwards with his children. The good old
Sachem died in peace, and was happily gathered to his fathers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
before sorrow came upon his tribe; his children remained behind
to experience the ingratitude of white men.</p>

<p>His eldest son, Alexander, succeeded him. He was of a quick
and impetuous temper, and <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref749">proudly tenacious</a> of his <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref750">hereditary
rights and dignity</a>. The <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref751">intrusive policy</a> and dictatorial conduct
of the strangers excited his indignation; and he beheld with uneasiness
their exterminating wars with the neighboring tribes.
He was doomed soon to incur their hostility, being accused of
plotting with the Narragansets to rise against the English and
drive them from the land. It is impossible to say whether this
accusation was warranted by facts or was grounded on mere suspicion.
It is evident, however, by the violent and overbearing
measures of the settlers, that they had by this time begun to feel
conscious of the rapid increase of their power, and to grow harsh
and inconsiderate in their treatment of the natives. They despatched
an armed force to seize upon Alexander, and to bring
him before their courts. He was traced to his woodland haunts,
and surprised at a hunting house, where he was reposing with a
band of his followers, unarmed, <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref752">after the toils of the chase</a>. The
suddenness of his arrest, and the outrage offered to his <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref753">sovereign
dignity</a>, so preyed upon the irascible feelings of this proud savage,
as to throw him into a raging fever. He was permitted to return
home, on condition of sending his son as a pledge for his reappearance;
but the blow he had received was fatal, and before he had
reached his home he fell a victim to the agonies of a wounded
spirit.</p>

<p>The successor of Alexander was Metacomet, or King Philip,
as he was called by the settlers, on account of his lofty spirit and
ambitious temper. These, together with his well-known energy
and enterprise, had rendered him an object of great jealousy and
apprehension, and he was accused of having always cherished a
secret and <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref754">implacable hostility</a> toward the whites. Such may
very probably, and very naturally, have been the case. He considered
them as originally but mere intruders into the country,
who had presumed upon indulgence, and were extending an influence
baneful to savage life. He saw the whole race of his countrymen
melting before them from the face of the earth; their territories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
slipping from their hands, and their tribes becoming feeble,
scattered, and dependent. It may be said that the soil was originally
purchased by the settlers; but who does not know the nature
of Indian purchases, in the early periods of colonization? The
Europeans always made thrifty bargains through their <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref755">superior
adroitness</a> in traffic; and they gained vast accessions of territory
by <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref756">easily provoked hostilities</a>. An uncultivated savage is never a
nice inquirer into the refinements of law, by which an injury may
be gradually and legally inflicted. Leading facts are all by which
he judges; and it was enough for Philip to know that before the
intrusion of the Europeans his countrymen were lords of the soil,
and that now they were becoming vagabonds in the land of their
fathers.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been his feelings of general hostility,
and his particular indignation at the treatment of his brother, he
suppressed them for the present, renewed the contract with the
settlers, and resided peaceably for many years at Pokanoket, or,
as it was called by the English, Mount Hope, the ancient seat of
dominion of his tribe. Suspicions, however, which were at first
but vague and indefinite, began to acquire form and substance;
and he was at length charged with attempting to instigate the
various Eastern tribes to rise at once, and, by a simultaneous
effort, to throw off the yoke of their oppressors. It is difficult at
this distant period to assign the proper credit due to these early
accusations against the Indians. There was a <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref757">proneness to suspicion</a>,
and an aptness to acts of violence, on the part of the whites,
that gave weight and importance to every idle tale. Informers
abounded where talebearing met with countenance and reward;
and the sword was readily unsheathed when its success was certain,
and it carved out empire.</p>

<p>The only positive evidence on record against Philip is the
accusation of one Sausaman, a renegado Indian, whose natural
cunning had been quickened by a partial education which he had
received among the settlers. He changed his faith and his allegiance
two or three times, with a facility that evinced the looseness
of his principles. He had acted for some time as Philip’s
confidential secretary and counselor and had enjoyed his bounty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
and protection. Finding, however, that the clouds of adversity
were gathering round his patron, he abandoned his service and
went over to the whites; and, in order to gain their favor, charged
his former benefactor with plotting against their safety. A rigorous
investigation took place. Philip and several of his subjects
submitted to be examined, but nothing was proved against them.
The settlers, however, had now gone too far to retract; they had
previously determined that Philip was a dangerous neighbor;
they had publicly evinced their distrust; and had done enough to
insure his hostility; according, therefore, to the usual mode of
reasoning in these cases, his destruction had become necessary to
their security. Sausaman, the treacherous informer, was shortly
afterwards found dead in a pond, having fallen a victim to the
vengeance of his tribe. Three Indians, one of whom was a friend
and counselor of Philip, were apprehended and tried, and, on the
testimony of one very questionable witness, were condemned and
executed as murderers.</p>

<p>This treatment of his subjects, and <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref758">ignominious punishment</a> of
his friend, outraged the pride and <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref759">exasperated the passions</a> of
Philip. The bolt which had fallen thus at his very feet awakened
him to the gathering storm, and he determined to trust himself
no longer in the power of the white men. The fate of his insulted
and broken-hearted brother still rankled in his mind and he had
a further warning in the tragical story of Miantonimo, a great
Sachem of the Narragansets, who, after manfully facing his accusers
before a tribunal of the colonists, exculpating himself from
a charge of conspiracy, and receiving assurances of amity, had
been <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref760">perfidiously despatched</a> at their instigation. Philip, therefore,
gathered his fighting men about him; persuaded all strangers
that he could, to join his cause; sent the women and children to
the Narragansets for safety; and, wherever he appeared, was
continually surrounded by armed warriors.</p>

<p>When the two parties were thus in a state of distrust and irritation,
the least spark was sufficient to set them in a flame. The
Indians, having weapons in their hands, grew mischievous, and
committed various petty depredations. In one of their maraudings
a warrior was fired on and killed by a settler. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
signal for open hostilities; the Indians pressed to revenge the
death of their comrade, and the alarm of war resounded through
the Plymouth colony.</p>

<p>In the early chronicles of these dark and melancholy times we
meet with many indications of the diseased state of the public
mind. The gloom of <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref761">religious abstraction</a>, and the wildness of
their situation, among trackless forests and savage tribes, had
disposed the colonists to <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref762">superstitious fancies</a>, and had filled their
imaginations with the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref763">frightful chimeras of witchcraft</a> and spectrology.
They were much given also to a belief in omens. The
troubles with Philip and his Indians were preceded, we are told,
by a variety of those awful warnings which forerun great and
public calamities. The perfect form of an Indian bow appeared
in the air at New Plymouth, which was looked upon by the inhabitants
as a “prodigious apparition,” At Hadley, Northampton,
and other towns in their neighborhood, “was heard the report of a
great piece of ordnance, with a shaking of the earth and a considerable
echo.” Others were alarmed on a still, sunshiny morning,
by the discharge of guns and muskets; bullets seemed to
whistle past them, and the noise of drums resounded in the air,
seeming to pass away to the westward; others fancied that they
heard the galloping of horses over their heads; and certain monstrous
births, which took place about the time, filled the superstitious
in some towns with doleful forebodings. Many of these
<a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref764">portentous sights and sounds</a> may be ascribed to natural phenomena:
to the northern lights which occur vividly in those latitudes;
the meteors which explode in the air; the casual rushing
of a blast through the top branches of the forest; the crash of
fallen trees or disrupted rocks; and to those other uncouth sounds
and echoes which will sometimes strike the ear so strangely amidst
the profound stillness of woodland solitudes. These may have
startled some melancholy imaginations, may have been exaggerated
by the love of the marvelous, and listened to with that
avidity with which we devour whatever is fearful and mysterious.
The universal currency of these superstitious fancies, and the
grave record made of them by one of the learned men of the day,
are strongly characteristic of the times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>The nature of the contest that ensued was such as too often
distinguishes the warfare between civilized men and savages.
On the part of the whites it was conducted with superior skill
and success; but with a wastefulness of the blood, and a disregard
of the natural rights of their antagonists; on the part of the
Indians it was waged with the desperation of men fearless of
death, and who had nothing to expect from peace, but humiliation,
dependence, and decay.</p>

<p>The events of the war are transmitted to us by a worthy
clergyman of the time, who dwells with horror and indignation on
every hostile act of the Indians, however justifiable, whilst he
mentions with applause the most sanguinary atrocities of the
whites. Philip is reviled as a murderer and a traitor, without
considering that he was a true born prince, gallantly fighting at
the head of his subjects to avenge the wrongs of his family, to
retrieve the tottering power of his line, and to deliver his native
land from the oppression of usurping strangers.</p>

<p>The project of a wide and simultaneous revolt, if such had
really been formed, was worthy of a <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref765">capacious mind</a>, and, had it
not been prematurely discovered, might have been overwhelming
in its consequences. The war that actually broke out was but a
war of detail, a mere succession of <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref766">casual exploits</a> and unconnected
enterprises. Still it sets forth the military genius and
daring prowess of Philip; and wherever, in the prejudiced and
passionate narrations that have been given of it, we can arrive at
simple facts, we find him displaying a vigorous mind, a <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref767">fertility
of expedients</a>, a contempt of suffering and hardship, and an unconquerable
resolution, that command our sympathy and
applause.</p>

<p>Driven from his paternal domains at Mount Hope, he threw
himself into the depths of those vast and trackless forests that
skirted the settlements, and were almost impervious to anything
but a wild beast or an Indian. Here he gathered together his
forces, like the storm accumulating its stores of mischief in the
bosom of the thunder cloud, and would suddenly emerge at a time
and place least expected, carrying havoc and dismay into the
villages. There were now and then indications of these <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref768">impending
ravages</a>, that filled the minds of the colonists with awe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
apprehension. The report of a distant gun would perhaps be
heard from the solitary woodlands, where there was known to be
no white man; the cattle which had been wandering in the woods
would sometimes return home wounded; or an Indian or two
would be seen lurking about the skirts of the forests, and suddenly
disappearing; as the lightning will sometimes be seen playing
silently about the edge of the cloud that is brewing up the
tempest.</p>

<p>Though sometimes pursued and even surrounded by the settlers,
yet Philip as often escaped almost miraculously from their
toils, and, plunging into the wilderness, would be lost to all search
or inquiry, until he again emerged at some far distant quarter,
laying the country desolate. Among his strongholds were the
great swamps or morasses, which extend in some parts of New
England; composed of loose bogs of deep black mud; perplexed
with thickets, brambles, rank weeds, the shattered and moldering
trunks of fallen trees, overshadowed by <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref769">lugubrious hemlocks</a>.
The uncertain footing and the tangled mazes of these shaggy
wilds rendered them almost impracticable to the white man,
though the Indian could thread their labyrinths with the agility
of a deer. Into one of these, the great swamp of Pocasset Neck,
was Philip once driven with a band of his followers. The English
did not dare to pursue him, fearing to venture into these dark and
frightful recesses, where they might perish in fens and miry pits,
or be shot down by lurking foes. They therefore invested the
entrance to the Neck, and began to build a fort, with the thought
of starving out the foe; but Philip and his warriors wafted themselves
on a raft over an arm of the sea, in the dead of the night,
leaving the women and children behind; and escaped away to the
westward, kindling the flames of war among the tribes of Massachusetts
and the Nipmuck country, and threatening the colony of
Connecticut.</p>

<p>In this way Philip became a theme of universal apprehension.
The mystery in which he was enveloped exaggerated his real
terrors. He was an evil that walked in darkness; whose coming
none could foresee, and against which none knew when to be on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
the alert. The whole country abounded with rumors and alarms.
Philip seemed almost <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref770">possessed of ubiquity</a>; for, in whatever part
of the widely-extended frontier an irruption from the forest took
place, Philip was said to be its leader. Many superstitious notions
also were circulated concerning him. He was said to deal
in necromancy, and to be attended by an old Indian witch or
prophetess, whom he consulted, and who assisted him by her
charms and incantations. This indeed was frequently the case
with Indian chiefs; either through their own credulity, or to act
upon that of their followers; and the influence of the prophet and
the dreamer over Indian superstition has been fully evidenced in
recent instances of savage warfare.</p>

<p>At the time that Philip effected his escape from Pocasset, his
fortunes were in a desperate condition. His forces had been
thinned by repeated fights, and he had lost almost the whole of
his resources. In this time of adversity he found a faithful friend
in Canonchet, chief Sachem of all the Narragansets. He was the
son and heir of Miantonimo, the great Sachem, who, as already
mentioned, after an honorable acquittal of the charge of conspiracy,
had been privately put to death at the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref771">perfidious instigations</a>
of the settlers. “He was the heir,” says the old chronicler,
“of all his father’s pride and insolence, as well as of his
malice toward the English”;—he certainly was the heir of his
insults and injuries, and the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref772">legitimate avenger</a> of his murder.
Though he had forborne to take an active part in this hopeless
war, yet he received Philip and his broken forces with open arms;
and gave them the most generous countenance and support. This
at once drew upon him the hostility of the English; and it was
determined to strike a signal blow that should involve both the
Sachems in one common ruin. A great force was, therefore,
gathered together from Massachusetts, Plymouth, and Connecticut,
and was sent into the Narraganset country in the depth of
winter, when the swamps, being frozen and leafless, could be
traversed with <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref773">comparative facility</a>, and would no longer afford
dark and impenetrable fastnesses to the Indians.</p>

<p>Apprehensive of attack, Canonchet had conveyed the greater
part of his stores, together with the old, the infirm, the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
and children of his tribe, to a strong fortress; where he and Philip
had likewise drawn up the flower of their forces. This fortress,
deemed by the Indians impregnable, was situated upon a rising
mound or kind of island, of five or six acres, in the midst of a
swamp; it was constructed with a degree of judgment and skill
vastly superior to what is usually displayed in Indian fortification,
and indicative of the martial genius of these two chieftains.</p>

<p>Guided by a renegado Indian, the English penetrated, through
December snows, to this stronghold, and came upon the garrison
by surprise. The fight was fierce and tumultuous. The assailants
were repulsed in their first attack, and several of their bravest
officers were shot down in the act of storming the fortress sword in
hand. The assault was renewed with greater success. A lodgment
was effected. The Indians were driven from one post to
another. They disputed their ground inch by inch, fighting with
the fury of despair. Most of their veterans were cut to pieces;
and after a long and bloody battle, Philip and Canonchet, with a
handful of surviving warriors, retreated from the fort, and took
refuge in the thickets of the surrounding forest.</p>

<p>The victors set fire to the wigwams and the fort; the whole
was soon in a blaze; many of the old men, the women, and the
children perished in the flames. This last outrage overcame even
the stoicism of the savage. The neighboring woods resounded
with the yells of rage and despair, uttered by the fugitive warriors,
as they beheld the destruction of their dwellings, and heard
the agonizing cries of their wives and offspring. “The burning of
the wigwams,” says a contemporary writer, “the shrieks and cries
of the women and children, and the yelling of the warriors, exhibited
a most horrible and affecting scene, so that it greatly moved
some of the soldiers.” The same writer cautiously adds, “They
were in <em>much doubt</em> then, and afterwards seriously inquired,
whether burning their enemies alive could be consistent with
humanity, and the benevolent principles of the Gospel.”</p>

<p>The fate of the brave and generous Canonchet is worthy of
particular mention: the last scene of his life is one of the noblest
instances on record of Indian magnanimity.</p>

<p>Broken down in his power and resources by this signal defeat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
yet faithful to his ally, and to the hapless cause which he had
espoused, he rejected all overtures of peace, offered on condition
of betraying Philip and his followers, and declared that “he
would fight it out to the last man, rather than become a servant
to the English.” His home being destroyed, his country harassed
and laid waste by the <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref774">incursions of the conquerors</a>, he was obliged
to wander away to the banks of the Connecticut; where he formed
a rallying point to the whole body of western Indians, and laid
waste several of the English settlements.</p>

<p>Early in the spring he departed on a hazardous expedition,
with only thirty chosen men, to penetrate to Seaconck, in the
vicinity of Mount Hope, and to procure seed corn to plant for
the sustenance of his troops. This little band of adventurers had
passed safely through the Pequod country, and were in the center
of the Narraganset, resting at some wigwams near Pawtucket
River, when an alarm was given of an approaching enemy. Having
but seven men by him at the time, Canonchet dispatched
two of them to the top of a neighboring hill, to bring intelligence
of the foe.</p>

<p>Panic-struck by the appearance of a troop of English and
Indians rapidly advancing, they fled in breathless terror past their
chieftain, without stopping to inform him of the danger. Canonchet
sent another scout, who did the same. He then sent two
more, one of whom, hurrying back in confusion and affright, told
him that the whole British army was at hand. Canonchet saw
there was no choice but immediate flight. He attempted to escape
round the hill, but was perceived and hotly pursued by the hostile
Indians and a few of the fleetest of the English. Finding the
swiftest pursuer close upon his heels, he threw off, first his blanket,
then his silver-laced coat and belt of peag, by which his enemies
knew him to be Canonchet, and redoubled the eagerness of pursuit.</p>

<p>At length, in dashing through the river, his foot slipped upon
a stone, and he fell so deep as to wet his gun. This accident so
struck him with despair, that, as he afterwards confessed, “his
heart and his bowels turned within him, and he became like a
rotten stick, void of strength.”</p>

<p>To such a degree was he unnerved that, being seized by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
Pequod Indian within a short distance of the river, he made no
resistance, though a man of great vigor of body and boldness of
heart. But on being made prisoner the whole pride of his spirit
arose within him; and from that moment we find, in the anecdotes
given by his enemies, nothing but repeated flashes of elevated
and prince-like heroism. Being questioned by one of the
English who first came up with him, and who had not attained
his twenty-second year, the proud-hearted warrior, looking with
lofty contempt upon his youthful countenance, replied, “You are
a child—you cannot understand matters of war—let your brother
or your chief come—him will I answer.”</p>

<p>Though repeated offers were made to him of his life, on condition
of submitting with his nation to the English, yet he rejected
them with disdain, and refused to send any proposals of the kind
to the great body of his subjects; saying that he knew none of
them would comply. Being reproached with his breach of faith
toward the whites, his boast that he would not deliver up a
Wampanoag nor the paring of a Wampanoag’s nail, and his threat
that he would burn the English alive in their houses, he disdained
to justify himself, haughtily answering that others were as forward
for the war as himself, and he desired to hear no more
thereof.</p>

<p>So noble and unshaken a spirit, so true a fidelity to his cause
and his friend, might have touched the feelings of the generous
and the brave; but Canonchet was an Indian, a being toward
whom war had no courtesy, humanity no law, religion no compassion—he
was condemned to die. The last words of him that
are recorded are worthy the greatness of his soul. When sentence
of death was passed upon him, he observed that he liked it well,
for he should die before his heart was soft, or he had spoken any
thing unworthy of himself. His enemies gave him the death of
a soldier, for he was shot at Stoningham, by three young Sachems
of his own rank.</p>

<p>The defeat at the Narraganset fortress, and the death of
Canonchet, were fatal blows to the fortunes of King Philip. He
made an ineffectual attempt to raise a head of war, by stirring up
the Mohawks to take arms; but though possessed of the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
talents of a statesman, his arts were counteracted by the superior
arts of his enlightened enemies, and the terror of their warlike
skill began to <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref775">subdue the resolution</a> of the neighboring tribes.
The unfortunate chieftain saw himself daily stripped of power,
and his ranks rapidly thinning around him. Some were <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref776">suborned
by the whites</a>; others fell victims to hunger and fatigue, and to
the frequent attacks by which they were harassed. His stores
were all captured; his chosen friends were swept away from before
his eyes; his uncle was shot down by his side; his sister was carried
into captivity; and in one of his narrow escapes he was compelled
to leave his beloved wife and only son to the mercy of the
enemy. “His ruin,” says the historian, “being thus gradually
carried on, his misery was not prevented, but augmented thereby;
being himself made acquainted with the sense and experimental
feeling of the captivity of his children, loss of friends, slaughter
of his subjects, bereavement of all family relations, and being
stripped of all outward comforts, before his own life should be
taken away.”</p>

<p>To fill up the measure of his misfortunes, his own followers
began to plot against his life, that by sacrificing him they might
purchase dishonorable safety. Through treachery a number of
his faithful adherents, the subjects of Wetamoe, an Indian princess
of Pocasset, a near kinswoman and confederate of Philip, were
betrayed into the hands of the enemy. Wetamoe was among
them at the time, and attempted to make her escape by crossing
a neighboring river; either exhausted by swimming, or starved by
cold and hunger, she was found dead and naked near the water
side.</p>

<p>However Philip had borne up against the complicated miseries
and misfortunes that surrounded him, the treachery of his
followers seemed to wring his heart and reduce him to despondency.
It is said that “he never rejoiced afterwards, nor had
success in any of his designs.” The spring of hope was broken—the
ardor of enterprise was extinguished—he looked around,
and all was danger and darkness; there was no eye to pity, nor
any arm that could bring deliverance. With a scanty band of
followers, who still remained true to his desperate fortunes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
unhappy Philip wandered back to the vicinity of Mount Hope,
the ancient dwelling of his fathers. Here he lurked about, like
a specter, among the scenes of former power and prosperity, now
bereft of home, of family, and friend. There needs no better picture
of his destitute and piteous situation than that furnished by
the homely pen of the chronicler, who is unwarily enlisting the
feelings of the reader in favor of the hapless warrior whom he
reviles. “Philip,” he says, “like a savage wild beast, having been
hunted by the English forces through the woods, above a hundred
miles backward and forward, at last was driven to his own den
upon Mount Hope, where he retired, with a few of his best friends,
into a swamp, which proved but a prison to keep him fast till the
messengers of death came by divine permission to execute vengeance
upon him.”</p>

<p>Even in this last refuge of desperation and despair, a <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref777">sullen
grandeur</a> gathers round his memory. We picture him to ourselves
seated among his careworn followers, brooding in silence
over his blasted fortunes, and acquiring a <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref778">savage sublimity</a> from
the wildness and dreariness of his lurking-place. Defeated, but
not dismayed—crushed to the earth, but not humiliated—he
seemed to grow more haughty beneath disaster, and to experience
a fierce satisfaction in draining the last dregs of bitterness. Little
minds are tamed and subdued by misfortune; but great minds
rise above it. The very idea of submission awakened the fury of
Philip, and he smote to death one of his followers, who proposed
an expedient of peace. The brother of the victim made his escape,
and in revenge betrayed the retreat of his chieftain. A body of
white men and Indians were immediately dispatched to the
swamp where Philip lay crouched, glaring with fury and despair.
Before he was aware of their approach, they had begun to surround
him. In a little while he saw five of his trustiest followers
laid dead at his feet; all resistance was vain; he rushed forth from
his covert, and made a headlong attempt to escape, but was shot
through the heart by a renegado Indian of his own nation.</p>

<p>Such is the scanty story of the brave but unfortunate King
Philip; persecuted while living, slandered and dishonored when
dead. If, however, we consider even the prejudiced anecdotes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
furnished us by his enemies, we may perceive in them traces of
amiable and lofty character sufficient to awaken sympathy for
his fate and respect for his memory. We find that, amidst all the
harassing cares and ferocious passions of constant warfare, he
was alive to the softer feelings of connubial love and paternal
tenderness, and to the generous sentiment of friendship. The
captivity of his “beloved wife and only son” are mentioned with
exultation as causing him poignant misery; the death of any near
friend is triumphantly recorded as a new blow on his sensibilities;
but the treachery and desertion of many of his followers, in whose
affections he had confided, is said to have desolated his heart, and
to have bereaved him of all further comfort. He was a patriot
attached to his native soil—a prince true to his subjects, and
indignant of their wrongs—a soldier, daring in battle, firm in
adversity, patient of fatigue, of hunger, of every variety of bodily
suffering, and ready to perish in the cause he had espoused. Proud
of heart, and with an untamable love of natural liberty, he preferred
to enjoy it among the beasts of the forests or in the dismal
and famished recesses of swamps and morasses, rather than bow
his haughty spirit to submission, and live dependent and despised
in the ease and luxury of the settlements. With heroic qualities
and bold achievements that would have <a href="#phrases70" title="List of phrases" id="ref779">graced a civilized warrior</a>
and have rendered him the theme of the poet and the historian,
he lived a wanderer and a fugitive in his native land, and went
down, like a lonely bark foundering amid darkness and tempest—without
a pitying eye to weep his fall or a friendly hand to
record his struggle.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Washington Irving (1783-1859) was born in New York
City in the very year in which the Treaty of Peace that ended the Revolutionary
War was signed. He was destined to do for American literature
what the War had already done for the American government and people—make
it respected among all nations. Irving’s mother said, “Washington’s
great work is done; let us name our boy Washington,” little dreaming
when thus naming him after the Father of his Country that he should one
day come to be called the “Father of American Letters.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>On April 30, 1789, when this little boy was six years old, his father took
him to Federal Hall in Wall Street, to witness Washington’s inauguration
as the first president of the United States. It is told that President Washington
laid his hand kindly on the head of his little namesake and gave him
his blessing.</p>

<p>Young Washington Irving led a happy life, rambling in his boyhood
about every nook and corner of the city and the adjacent woods, which at
that time were not very far to seek, idling about the busy wharves, making
occasional trips up the lordly Hudson, roaming, gun in hand, along its banks
and over the neighboring Kaatskills, listening to the tales of old Dutch
landlords and gossipy old Dutch housewives. When he became a young man
he wove these old tales, scenes, experiences, and much more that his imagination
and his merry humor added, into some of the most rollicking, mirthful
stories that had been read in many a day. The first of these was a
burlesque <cite>History of New York</cite>, purporting to have been found among the
papers of a certain old Dutch burgher by the name of Diedrich Knickerbocker
(1809). This may be said to have been his first important work. It
made him instantly famous. But better than that, it silenced the sneers of
the English critics who, up to that time, had been asking contemptuously,
“Who reads an American book?” and set them all to reading and laughing
over it with the rest of the world. It also showed to Americans as well as
to foreigners what wealth of literary material this new country already
possessed in its local legends and history.</p>

<p>Ten years later, during his residence in England (1819-20), Irving published
<cite>The Sketch Book</cite>, containing the inimitable “Rip van Winkle” and
the delightful “Legend of Sleepy Hollow.” This may be said to mark the
real beginning of American literature.</p>

<p>A visit to Spain resulted in <cite>The Alhambra</cite> and <cite>The Life of Columbus</cite>,
descriptive and historical works in which Irving won as great success as he
had attained with his humorous tales. Then followed some years of
quiet life at his beautiful home, Sunnyside, near Tarrytown on the Hudson,
in the midst of the favorite haunts of his boyhood days and the scenes
which his pen had immortalized. He was not idle, however, for a half-dozen
works appeared during these stay-at-home years, some of them growing
out of his travels through our then rapidly expanding West. Only
once more did he leave his native shores, when he served as Minister to
Spain (1842-46). But through all his life he seems to have cherished a
patriotic reverence for the great American whose name he bore, and now,
as the crowning work of his ripe old age, he devoted his last years to completing
his <cite>Life of Washington</cite>, the fifth and final volume of which appeared
but a few months before his death on November 28, 1859. His genial,
cheerful nature shines through all his works and makes him still, as his
friend Thackeray said of him in his lifetime, “beloved of all the world.”</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. What effect does Irving say civilized life has upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
traits of native character? 2. Explain the comparison, “Society is like a
lawn.” 3. Who was Philip of Pokanoket? 4. What “league of peace” did
Massasoit make with the Plymouth settlers? 5. Give an account of Alexander’s
career as Sachem. 6. What was the attitude of the white settlers
toward Philip? 7. What evidence of friendliness toward the settlers did
he give? 8. What omens disturbed the Indians? 9. What natural explanation
can you give for these “awful warnings”? 10. Give a brief account of
the Indian war that followed. 11. Describe the death of King Philip. 12.
Point out evidences of military ability on the part of King Philip. 13. What
traces of lofty character does Philip show in the face of persecution? 14.
Read passages that show his courage. 15. Does Irving give you the impression
that the white settlers may have been partly responsible for the
conflict with King Philip and his followers? 16. Other interesting books
dealing with Indian life are Cooper’s <cite>Leather Stocking Tales</cite> and his <cite>The
Last of the Mohicans</cite>; have you read these? 17. Pronounce the following:
attributes; aborigines; Sachem; amity; tenacious; haunts; implacable;
simultaneous; patron; mischievous; revolt; indicative; harassed.</p>

<h4>THE COURTSHIP OF MILES STANDISH</h4>

<h5>MILES STANDISH</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">In the Old Colony days, in Plymouth the land of the Pilgrims,</div>
<div class="verse">To and fro in a room of his simple and primitive dwelling,</div>
<div class="verse">Clad in doublet and hose, and boots of Cordovan leather,</div>
<div class="verse">Strode, with a martial air, Miles Standish the Puritan Captain.</div>
<div class="verse">Buried in thought he seemed, with his hands behind him, and pausing</div>
<div class="verse">Ever and anon to behold his glittering weapons of warfare,</div>
<div class="verse">Hanging in shining array along the walls of the chamber—</div>
<div class="verse">Cutlass and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref780">corselet of steel</a>, and his trusty sword of Damascus,</div>
<div class="verse">Curved at the point and inscribed with its <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref781">mystical Arabic sentence,</a></div>
<div class="verse">While underneath, in a corner, were fowling-piece, musket, and matchlock.</div>
<div class="verse">Short of stature he was, but strongly built and athletic,</div>
<div class="verse">Broad in the shoulders, deep-chested, with muscles and sinews of iron;</div>
<div class="verse">Brown as a nut was his face, but his russet beard was already</div>
<div class="verse">Flaked with patches of snow, as hedges sometimes in November.</div>
<div class="verse">Near him was seated John Alden, his friend, and household companion,</div>
<div class="verse">Writing with diligent speed at a table of pine by the window;</div>
<div class="verse">Fair-haired, azure-eyed, with delicate Saxon complexion,</div>
<div class="verse">Having the dew of his youth, and the beauty thereof, as the captives</div>
<div class="verse">Whom Saint Gregory saw, and exclaimed, “Not Angles but Angels.”</div>
<div class="verse">Youngest of all was he of the men who came in the May Flower.</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Suddenly breaking the silence, the diligent scribe interrupting,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Spake, in the pride of his heart, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth.</div>
<div class="verse">“Look at these arms,” he said, “the warlike weapons that hang here,</div>
<div class="verse">Burnished and bright and clean, as if for parade or inspection!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the sword of Damascus I fought with in Flanders; this breast-plate,</div>
<div class="verse">Well I remember the day! once saved my life in a skirmish;</div>
<div class="verse">Here in front you can see the very dint of the bullet</div>
<div class="verse">Fired point-blank at my heart by a <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref782">Spanish arcabucero</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">Had it not been of sheer steel, the forgotten bones of Miles Standish</div>
<div class="verse">Would at this moment be mold, in their grave in the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref783">Flemish morasses</a>.”</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, but looked not up from his writing:</div>
<div class="verse">“Truly the breath of the Lord hath slackened the speed of the bullet;</div>
<div class="verse">He in his mercy preserved you, to be our shield and our weapon!”</div>
<div class="verse">Still the Captain continued, unheeding the words of the stripling:</div>
<div class="verse">“See, how bright they are burnished, as if in an arsenal hanging;</div>
<div class="verse">That is because I have done it myself, and not left it to others.</div>
<div class="verse">Serve yourself, would you be well served, is an excellent adage;</div>
<div class="verse">So I take care of my arms, as you of your pens and your ink-horn.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, too, there are my soldiers, my great, invincible army,</div>
<div class="verse">Twelve men, all equipped, having each his rest and his matchlock,</div>
<div class="verse">Eighteen shillings a month, together with diet and pillage,</div>
<div class="verse">And, like Cæsar, I know the name of each of my soldiers!”</div>
<div class="verse">This he said with a smile, that danced in his eyes, as the sunbeams</div>
<div class="verse">Dance on the waves of the sea, and vanish again in a moment.</div>
<div class="verse">Alden laughed as he wrote, and still the Captain continued:</div>
<div class="verse">“Look! you can see from this window my <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref784">brazen howitzer</a> planted</div>
<div class="verse">High on the roof of the church, a preacher who speaks to the purpose,</div>
<div class="verse">Steady, straightforward, and strong, with <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref785">irresistible logic</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Orthodox, flashing conviction right into the hearts of the heathen.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Now we are ready, I think, for any assault of the Indians;</div>
<div class="verse">Let them come, if they like, and the sooner they try it the better—</div>
<div class="verse">Let them come if they like, be it sagamore, sachem, or pow-wow,</div>
<div class="verse">Aspinet, Samoset, Corbitant, Squanto, or Tokamahamon!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Long at the window he stood, and wistfully gazed on the landscape,</div>
<div class="verse">Washed with a cold gray mist, the vapory breath of the east wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Forest and meadow and hill, and the steel-blue rim of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Lying silent and sad, in the afternoon shadows and sunshine.</div>
<div class="verse">Over his countenance flitted a shadow like those on the landscape,</div>
<div class="verse">Gloom intermingled with light; and his voice was subdued with emotion,</div>
<div class="verse">Tenderness, pity, regret, as after a pause he proceeded:</div>
<div class="verse">“Yonder there, on the hill by the sea, lies buried Rose Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful rose of love, that bloomed for me by the wayside!</div>
<div class="verse">She was the first to die of all who came in the May Flower!</div>
<div class="verse">Green above her is growing the field of wheat we have sown there,</div>
<div class="verse">Better to hide from the Indian scouts the graves of our people,</div>
<div class="verse">Lest they should count them and see how many already have perished!”</div>
<div class="verse">Sadly his face he averted, and strode up and down, and was thoughtful.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Fixed to the opposite wall was a shelf of books, and among them</div>
<div class="verse">Prominent three, distinguished alike for bulk and for binding:</div>
<div class="verse">Bariffe’s Artillery Guide, and the Commentaries of Cæsar,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the Latin translated by Arthur Goldinge of London,</div>
<div class="verse">And, as if guarded by these, between them was standing the Bible.</div>
<div class="verse">Musing a moment before them, Miles Standish paused, as if doubtful</div>
<div class="verse">Which of the three he should choose for his consolation and comfort,</div>
<div class="verse">Whether the wars of the Hebrews, the famous campaigns of the Romans,</div>
<div class="verse">Or the Artillery practice, designed for <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref786">belligerent Christians</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">Finally down from its shelf he dragged the ponderous Roman,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Seated himself at the window, and opened the book, and in silence</div>
<div class="verse">Turned o’er the well-worn leaves, where thumb-marks thick on the margin,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the trample of feet, proclaimed the battle was hottest.</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,</div>
<div class="verse">Busily writing epistles important, to go by the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Ready to sail on the morrow, or next day at latest, God willing!</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward bound with the tidings of all that terrible winter,</div>
<div class="verse">Letters written by Alden, and full of the name of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Full of the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla!</div>
</div>
</div>

<h5>LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling,</div>
<div class="verse">Or an occasional sigh from the laboring heart of the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Reading the marvelous words and achievements of Julius Cæsar.</div>
<div class="verse">After a while he exclaimed, as he smote with his hands, palm downwards,</div>
<div class="verse">Heavily on the page: “A wonderful man was this Cæsar!</div>
<div class="verse">You are a writer, and I am a fighter, but here is a fellow</div>
<div class="verse">Who could both write and fight, and in both was equally skillful!”</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway answered and spake John Alden, the comely, the youthful:</div>
<div class="verse">“Yes, he was equally skilled, as you say, with his pen and his weapons.</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhere have I read, but where I forget, he could dictate</div>
<div class="verse">Seven letters at once, at the same time writing his memoirs.”</div>
<div class="verse">“Truly,” continued the Captain, not heeding or hearing the other,</div>
<div class="verse">“Truly a wonderful man was Caius Julius Cæsar!</div>
<div class="verse">Better be first, he said, in a little <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref787">Iberian village</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Than be second in Rome, and I think he was right when he said it.</div>
<div class="verse">Twice was he married before he was twenty, and many times after;</div>
<div class="verse">Battles five hundred he fought, and a thousand cities he conquered;</div>
<div class="verse">He, too, fought in Flanders, as he himself has recorded;</div>
<div class="verse">Finally he was stabbed by his friend, the orator Brutus!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Now, do you know what he did on a certain occasion in Flanders,</div>
<div class="verse">When the rear-guard of his army retreated, the front giving way too,</div>
<div class="verse">And the immortal Twelfth Legion was crowded so closely together</div>
<div class="verse">There was no room for their swords? Why, he seized a shield from a soldier,</div>
<div class="verse">Putting himself straight at the head of his troops, and commanded the captains,</div>
<div class="verse">Calling on each by his name, to order forward the ensigns;</div>
<div class="verse">Then to widen the ranks, and give more room for their weapons;</div>
<div class="verse">So he won the day, the battle of something-or-other.</div>
<div class="verse">That’s what I always say: if you wish a thing to be well done,</div>
<div class="verse">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">All was silent again; the Captain continued his reading.</div>
<div class="verse">Nothing was heard in the room but the hurrying pen of the stripling</div>
<div class="verse">Writing epistles important to go next day by the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled with the name and the fame of the Puritan maiden Priscilla;</div>
<div class="verse">Every sentence began or closed with the name of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the treacherous pen, to which he confided the secret,</div>
<div class="verse">Strove to betray it by singing and shouting the name of Priscilla!</div>
<div class="verse">Finally closing his book, with a bang of the ponderous cover,</div>
<div class="verse">Sudden and loud as the sound of a soldier <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref788">grounding his musket</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to the young man spake Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth:</div>
<div class="verse">“When you have finished your work, I have something important to tell you.</div>
<div class="verse">Be not however in haste; I can wait; I shall not be impatient!”</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway Alden replied, as he folded the last of his letters,</div>
<div class="verse">Pushing his papers aside, and giving respectful attention:</div>
<div class="verse">“Speak; for whenever you speak, I am always ready to listen,</div>
<div class="verse">Always ready to hear whatever pertains to Miles Standish.”</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered the Captain, embarrassed, and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref789">culling his phrases</a>:</div>
<div class="verse">“’Tis not good for a man to be alone, say the Scriptures.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
<div class="verse">This I have said before, and again and again I repeat it;</div>
<div class="verse">Every hour in the day, I think it, and feel it, and say it.</div>
<div class="verse">Since Rose Standish died, my life has been weary and dreary;</div>
<div class="verse">Sick at heart have I been, beyond the healing of friendship.</div>
<div class="verse">Oft in my lonely hours have I thought of the maiden Priscilla.</div>
<div class="verse">She is alone in the world; her father and mother and brother</div>
<div class="verse">Died in the winter together; I saw her going and coming,</div>
<div class="verse">Now to the grave of the dead, and now to the bed of the dying,</div>
<div class="verse">Patient, courageous, and strong, and said to myself, that if ever</div>
<div class="verse">There were angels on earth, as there are angels in heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Two have I seen and known; and the angel whose name is Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Holds in my desolate life the place which the other abandoned.</div>
<div class="verse">Long have I cherished the thought, but never have dared to reveal it,</div>
<div class="verse">Being a coward in this, though valiant enough for the most part.</div>
<div class="verse">Go to the damsel Priscilla, the loveliest maiden of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Say that a blunt old Captain, a man not of words but of actions,</div>
<div class="verse">Offers his hand and his heart, the hand and heart of a soldier.</div>
<div class="verse">Not in these words, you know, but this in short is my meaning;</div>
<div class="verse">I am a maker of war, and not a maker of phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">You, who are bred as a scholar, can say it in elegant language,</div>
<div class="verse">Such as you read in your books of the pleadings and wooings of lovers,</div>
<div class="verse">Such as you think best adapted to win the heart of a maiden.”</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">When he had spoken, John Alden, the fair-haired, <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref790">taciturn stripling</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">All aghast at his words, surprised, embarrassed, bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">Trying to <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref791">mask his dismay</a> by treating the subject with lightness,</div>
<div class="verse">Trying to smile, and yet feeling his heart stand still in his bosom,</div>
<div class="verse">Just as a timepiece stops in a house that is stricken by lightning,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus made answer and spake, or rather stammered than answered:</div>
<div class="verse">“Such a message as that I am sure I should mangle and mar it;</div>
<div class="verse">If you would have it well done—I am only repeating your maxim—</div>
<div class="verse">You must do it yourself, you must not leave it to others!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
<div class="verse">But with the air of a man whom nothing can turn from his purpose,</div>
<div class="verse">Gravely shaking his head, made answer the Captain of Plymouth:</div>
<div class="verse">“Truly the maxim is good, and I do not mean to gainsay it;</div>
<div class="verse">But we must use it discreetly, and not waste powder for nothing.</div>
<div class="verse">Now, as I said before, I was never a maker of phrases.</div>
<div class="verse">I can march up to a fortress and summon the place to surrender,</div>
<div class="verse">But march up to a woman with such a proposal, I dare not.</div>
<div class="verse">I’m not afraid of bullets, nor shot from the mouth of a cannon,</div>
<div class="verse">But of a thundering ‘No!’ point-blank from the mouth of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">That I confess I’m afraid of, nor am I ashamed to confess it!</div>
<div class="verse">So you must grant my request, for you are an elegant scholar,</div>
<div class="verse">Having the graces of speech, and skill in the turning of phrases.”</div>
<div class="verse">Taking the hand of his friend, who still was reluctant and doubtful,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding it long in his own, and pressing it kindly, he added:</div>
<div class="verse">“Though I have spoken thus lightly, yet deep is the feeling that prompts me;</div>
<div class="verse">Surely you cannot refuse what I ask in the name of our friendship!”</div>
<div class="verse">Then made answer John Alden: “The name of friendship is sacred;</div>
<div class="verse">What you demand in that name, I have not the power to deny you!”</div>
<div class="verse">So the strong will prevailed, subduing and molding the gentler,</div>
<div class="verse">Friendship prevailed over love, and Alden went on his errand.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h5>THE LOVER’S ERRAND</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">So the strong will prevailed, and Alden went on his errand,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the street of the village, and into the paths of the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the tranquil woods, where bluebirds and robins were building</div>
<div class="verse">Towns in the populous trees, with hanging gardens of verdure,</div>
<div class="verse">Peaceful, <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref792">aerial cities</a> of joy and affection and freedom.</div>
<div class="verse">All around him was calm, but within him commotion and conflict,</div>
<div class="verse">Love contending with friendship, and self with each generous impulse.</div>
<div class="verse">To and fro in his breast his thoughts were heaving and dashing,</div>
<div class="verse">As in a foundering ship, with every roll of the vessel,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Washes the bitter sea, the merciless surge of the ocean!</div>
<div class="verse">“Must I relinquish it all,” he cried with a wild lamentation,</div>
<div class="verse">“Must I relinquish it all, the joy, the hope, the illusion?</div>
<div class="verse">Was it for this I have loved, and waited, and worshiped in silence?</div>
<div class="verse">Was it for this I have followed the flying fleet and the shadow</div>
<div class="verse">Over the wintry sea, to the desolate shores of New England?</div>
<div class="verse">Truly the heart is deceitful, and out of its depths of corruption</div>
<div class="verse">Rise, like an exhalation, the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref793">misty phantoms</a> of passion;</div>
<div class="verse">Angels of light they seem, but are only delusions of Satan.</div>
<div class="verse">All is clear to me now; I feel it, I see it distinctly!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the hand of the Lord; it is laid upon me in anger,</div>
<div class="verse">For I have followed too much the heart’s desires and devices,</div>
<div class="verse">Worshiping Astaroth blindly, and impious idols of Baal.</div>
<div class="verse">This is the cross I must bear; the sin and the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref794">swift retribution</a>.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">Crossing the brook at the ford, where it brawled over pebble and shallow,</div>
<div class="verse">Gathering still, as he went, the May-flowers blooming around him,</div>
<div class="verse">Fragrant, filling the air with a strange and wonderful sweetness,</div>
<div class="verse">Children lost in the woods, and covered with leaves in their slumber.</div>
<div class="verse">“Puritan flowers,” he said, “and the type of Puritan maidens,</div>
<div class="verse">Modest and simple and sweet, the very type of Priscilla!</div>
<div class="verse">So I will take them to her; to Priscilla the May-flower of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Modest and simple and sweet, as a parting gift will I take them;</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing their silent farewells, as they fade and wither and perish,</div>
<div class="verse">Soon to be thrown away as is the heart of the giver.”</div>
<div class="verse">So through the Plymouth woods John Alden went on his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">Came to an open space, and saw the disk of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Sailless, somber, and cold with the comfortless breath of the east-wind;</div>
<div class="verse">Saw the new-built house, and people at work in a meadow;</div>
<div class="verse">Heard, as he drew near the door, the musical voice of Priscilla</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Singing the hundredth Psalm, the grand old Puritan anthem,</div>
<div class="verse">Music that Luther sang to the sacred words of the Psalmist,</div>
<div class="verse">Full of the breath of the Lord, consoling and comforting many.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, as he opened the door, he beheld the form of the maiden</div>
<div class="verse">Seated beside her wheel, and the carded wool like a snow-drift</div>
<div class="verse">Piled at her knee, her white hands feeding the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref795">ravenous spindle</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">While with her foot on the treadle she guided the wheel in its motion.</div>
<div class="verse">Open wide on her lap lay the well-worn psalm-book of Ainsworth,</div>
<div class="verse">Printed in Amsterdam, the words and the music together,</div>
<div class="verse">Rough-hewn, angular notes, like stones in the wall of a churchyard,</div>
<div class="verse">Darkened and overhung by the running vine of the verses.</div>
<div class="verse">Such was the book from whose pages she sang the old Puritan anthem,</div>
<div class="verse">She, the Puritan girl, in the solitude of the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Making the humble house and the modest apparel of home-spun</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful with her beauty, and rich with the wealth of her being!</div>
<div class="verse">Over him rushed, like a wind that is keen and cold and relentless,</div>
<div class="verse">Thoughts of what might have been, and the weight and woe of his errand;</div>
<div class="verse">All the dreams that had faded, and all the hopes that had vanished,</div>
<div class="verse">All his life henceforth a dreary and tenantless mansion,</div>
<div class="verse">Haunted by vain regrets, and pallid, sorrowful faces.</div>
<div class="verse">Still he said to himself, and almost fiercely he said it,</div>
<div class="verse">“Let not him that putteth his hand to the plow look backwards;</div>
<div class="verse">Though the plowshare cut through the flowers of life to its fountains,</div>
<div class="verse">Though it pass o’er the graves of the dead and the hearts of the living,</div>
<div class="verse">It is the will of the Lord; and his mercy endureth forever!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">So he entered the house; and the hum of the wheel and the singing</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly ceased; for Priscilla, aroused by his step on the threshold,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Rose as he entered, and gave him her hand, in signal of welcome,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, “I knew it was you, when I heard your step in the passage;</div>
<div class="verse">For I was thinking of you, as I sat there singing and spinning.”</div>
<div class="verse">Awkward and dumb with delight, that a thought of him had been mingled</div>
<div class="verse">Thus in the sacred psalm, that came from the heart of the maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">Silent before her he stood, and gave her the flowers for an answer,</div>
<div class="verse">Finding no words for his thought. He remembered that day in the winter,</div>
<div class="verse">After the first great snow, when he broke a path from the village,</div>
<div class="verse">Reeling and plunging along through the drifts that encumbered the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Stamping the snow from his feet as he entered the house, and Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Laughed at his snowy locks, and gave him a seat by the fireside,</div>
<div class="verse">Grateful and pleased to know he had thought of her in the snowstorm.</div>
<div class="verse">Had he but spoken then! perhaps not in vain had he spoken;</div>
<div class="verse">Now it was all too late; the golden moment had vanished!</div>
<div class="verse">So he stood there abashed, and gave her the flowers for an answer.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Then they sat down and talked of the birds and the beautiful Springtime,</div>
<div class="verse">Talked of their friends at home, and the May Flower that sailed on the morrow.</div>
<div class="verse">“I have been thinking all day,” said gently the Puritan maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">“Dreaming all night, and thinking all day, of the hedge-rows of England—</div>
<div class="verse">They are in blossom now, and the country is all like a garden;</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking of lanes and fields, and the song of the lark and the linnet,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing the village street, and familiar faces of neighbors</div>
<div class="verse">Going about as of old, and stopping to gossip together,</div>
<div class="verse">And, at the end of the street, the village church, with the ivy</div>
<div class="verse">Climbing the old gray tower, and the quiet graves in the churchyard.</div>
<div class="verse">Kind are the people I live with, and dear to me my religion;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Still my heart is so sad, that I wish myself back in Old England.</div>
<div class="verse">You will say it is wrong, but I cannot help it; I almost</div>
<div class="verse">Wish myself back in Old England, I feel so lonely and wretched.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Thereupon answered the youth:—“Indeed I do not condemn you;</div>
<div class="verse">Stouter hearts than a woman’s have quailed in this terrible winter.</div>
<div class="verse">Yours is tender and trusting, and needs a stronger to lean on;</div>
<div class="verse">So I have come to you now, with an offer and proffer of marriage</div>
<div class="verse">Made by a good man and true, Miles Standish the Captain of Plymouth!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Thus he delivered his message, the dexterous writer of letters—</div>
<div class="verse">Did not <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref796">embellish the theme</a>, nor array it in beautiful phrases,</div>
<div class="verse">But came straight to the point, and blurted it out like a schoolboy;</div>
<div class="verse">Even the Captain himself could hardly have said it more bluntly.</div>
<div class="verse">Mute with amazement and sorrow, Priscilla the Puritan maiden</div>
<div class="verse">Looked into Alden’s face, her eyes <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref797">dilated with wonder</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Feeling his words like a blow, that stunned her and rendered her speechless;</div>
<div class="verse">Till at length she exclaimed, interrupting the ominous silence:</div>
<div class="verse">“If the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,</div>
<div class="verse">Why does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?</div>
<div class="verse">If I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!”</div>
<div class="verse">Then John Alden began explaining and smoothing the matter,</div>
<div class="verse">Making it worse as he went, by saying the Captain was busy</div>
<div class="verse">Had no time for such things;—such things! the words grating harshly</div>
<div class="verse">Fell on the ear of Priscilla; and swift as a flash she made answer:</div>
<div class="verse">“Has he no time for such things, as you call it, before he is married,</div>
<div class="verse">Would he be likely to find it, or make it, after the wedding?</div>
<div class="verse">That is the way with you men; you don’t understand us, you cannot.</div>
<div class="verse">When you have made up your minds, after thinking of this one and that one,</div>
<div class="verse">Choosing, selecting, rejecting, comparing one with another,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then you make known your desire, with abrupt and sudden avowal,</div>
<div class="verse">And are offended and hurt, and indignant perhaps, that a woman</div>
<div class="verse">Does not respond at once to a love that she never suspected,</div>
<div class="verse">Does not attain at a bound the height to which you have been climbing.</div>
<div class="verse">This is not right nor just; for surely a woman’s affection</div>
<div class="verse">Is not a thing to be asked for, and had for only the asking.</div>
<div class="verse">When one is truly in love, one not only says it, but shows it.</div>
<div class="verse">Had he but waited awhile, had he only showed that he loved me,</div>
<div class="verse">Even this Captain of yours—who knows?—at last might have won me,</div>
<div class="verse">Old and rough as he is; but now it never can happen.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Still John Alden went on, unheeding the words of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Urging the suit of his friend, explaining, persuading, expanding;</div>
<div class="verse">Spoke of his courage and skill, and of all his battles in Flanders,</div>
<div class="verse">How with the people of God he had chosen to suffer affliction,</div>
<div class="verse">How, in return for his zeal, they had made him Captain of Plymouth;</div>
<div class="verse">He was a gentleman born, could trace his pedigree plainly</div>
<div class="verse">Back to Hugh Standish of Duxbury Hall, in Lancashire, England,</div>
<div class="verse">Who was the son of Ralph, and the grandson of Thurston de Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">Heir unto vast estates, of which he was basely defrauded,</div>
<div class="verse">Still bore the family arms, and had for his crest a cock argent</div>
<div class="verse">Combed and wattled gules, and all the rest of the blazon.</div>
<div class="verse">He was a man of honor, of noble and generous nature;</div>
<div class="verse">Though he was rough, he was kindly; she knew how during the winter</div>
<div class="verse">He had attended the sick, with a hand as gentle as woman’s;</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat hasty and hot, he could not deny it, and headstrong,</div>
<div class="verse">Stern as a soldier might be, but hearty, and placable always,</div>
<div class="verse">Not to be laughed at and scorned, because he was little of stature;</div>
<div class="verse">For he was great of heart, magnanimous, courtly, courageous;</div>
<div class="verse">Any woman in Plymouth, nay any woman in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Might be happy and proud to be called the wife of Miles Standish!</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">But as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language,</div>
<div class="verse">Quite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,</div>
<div class="verse">Archly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes overrunning with laughter,</div>
<div class="verse">Said, in a tremulous voice, “Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h5>JOHN ALDEN</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Into the open air John Alden, perplexed and bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">Rushed like a man insane, and wandered alone by the seaside;</div>
<div class="verse">Paced up and down the sands, and bared his head to the east wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Cooling his heated brow, and the fire and fever within him.</div>
<div class="verse">Slowly as out of the heavens, with <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref798">apocalyptical splendors</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Sank the City of God, in the vision of John the Apostle,</div>
<div class="verse">So, with its cloudy walls of chrysolite, jasper, and sapphire,</div>
<div class="verse">Sank the broad red sun, and over its turrets uplifted</div>
<div class="verse">Glimmered the golden reed of the angel who measured the city.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“Welcome, O wind of the East!” he exclaimed in his wild exultation,</div>
<div class="verse">“Welcome, O wind of the East, from the caves of the misty Atlantic!</div>
<div class="verse">Blowing o’er <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref799">fields of dulse</a>, and measureless meadows of sea-grass,</div>
<div class="verse">Blowing o’er rocky wastes, and the grottoes and gardens of ocean!</div>
<div class="verse">Lay thy cold, moist hand on my burning forehead, and wrap me</div>
<div class="verse">Close in thy garments of mist, to allay the fever within me!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Like an awakened conscience, the sea was moaning and tossing,</div>
<div class="verse">Beating remorseful and loud the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref800">mutable sands</a> of the seashore.</div>
<div class="verse">Fierce in his soul was the struggle and tumult of passions contending;</div>
<div class="verse">Love triumphant and crowned, and friendship wounded and bleeding,</div>
<div class="verse">Passionate cries of desire, and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref801">importunate pleadings</a> of duty!</div>
<div class="verse">“Is it my fault,” he said, “that the maiden has chosen between us?</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Is it my fault that he failed—my fault that I am the victor?”</div>
<div class="verse">Then within him there thundered a voice, like the voice of the Prophet:</div>
<div class="verse">“It hath displeased the Lord!”—and he thought of David’s transgression,</div>
<div class="verse">Bathsheba’s beautiful face, and his friend in the front of the battle!</div>
<div class="verse">Shame and confusion of guilt, and abasement and self-condemnation,</div>
<div class="verse">Overwhelmed him at once; and he cried in the deepest contrition:</div>
<div class="verse">“It hath displeased the Lord! It is the temptation of Satan!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Then, uplifting his head, he looked at the sea, and beheld there</div>
<div class="verse">Dimly the shadowy form of the May Flower riding at anchor,</div>
<div class="verse">Rocked on the rising tide, and ready to sail on the morrow;</div>
<div class="verse">Heard the voices of men through the mist, the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref802">rattle of cordage</a></div>
<div class="verse">Thrown on the deck, the shouts of the mate, and the sailors’ “Ay, ay, sir!”</div>
<div class="verse">Clear and distinct, but not loud, in the dripping air of the twilight.</div>
<div class="verse">Still for a moment he stood, and listened, and stared at the vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Then went hurriedly on, as one who, seeing a phantom,</div>
<div class="verse">Stops, then quickens his pace, and follows the beckoning shadow.</div>
<div class="verse">“Yes, it is plain to me now,” he murmured; “the hand of the Lord is</div>
<div class="verse">Leading me out of the land of darkness, the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref803">bondage of error</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Through the sea, that shall lift the walls of its waters around me,</div>
<div class="verse">Hiding me, cutting me off, from the cruel thoughts that pursue me.</div>
<div class="verse">Back will I go o’er the ocean, this dreary land will abandon,</div>
<div class="verse">Her whom I may not love, and him whom my heart has offended.</div>
<div class="verse">Better to be in my grave in the green old churchyard in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Close by my mother’s side, and among the dust of my kindred;</div>
<div class="verse">Better be dead and forgotten, than living in shame and dishonor!</div>
<div class="verse">Sacred and safe and unseen, in the dark of the narrow chamber</div>
<div class="verse">With me my secret shall lie, like a buried jewel that glimmers</div>
<div class="verse">Bright on the hand that is dust, in the chambers of silence and darkness—</div>
<div class="verse">Yes, as the marriage ring of the great espousal hereafter!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Thus as he spake, he turned, in the strength of his strong resolution,</div>
<div class="verse">Leaving behind him the shore, and hurried along in the twilight,</div>
<div class="verse">Through the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref804">congenial gloom</a> of the forest silent and somber,</div>
<div class="verse">Till he beheld the lights in the seven houses of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Shining like seven stars in the dusk and mist of the evening.</div>
<div class="verse">Soon he entered his door, and found the redoubtable Captain</div>
<div class="verse">Sitting alone, and absorbed in the martial pages of Cæsar,</div>
<div class="verse">Fighting some great campaign in Hainault or Brabant or Flanders.</div>
<div class="verse">“Long have you been on your errand,” he said with a cheery demeanor,</div>
<div class="verse">Even as one who is waiting an answer, and fears not the issue.</div>
<div class="verse">“Not far off is the house, although the woods are between us;</div>
<div class="verse">But you have lingered so long, that while you were going and coming</div>
<div class="verse">I have fought ten battles and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref805">sacked and demolished</a> a city.</div>
<div class="verse">Come, sit down, and in order relate to me all that has happened.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Then John Alden spake, and related the wondrous adventure,</div>
<div class="verse">From beginning to end, minutely, just as it happened;</div>
<div class="verse">How he had seen Priscilla, and how he had sped in his courtship,</div>
<div class="verse">Only smoothing a little, and softening down her refusal.</div>
<div class="verse">But when he came at length to the words Priscilla had spoken,</div>
<div class="verse">Words so tender and cruel: “Why don’t you speak for yourself, John?”</div>
<div class="verse">Up leaped the Captain of Plymouth, and stamped on the floor, till his armor</div>
<div class="verse">Clanged on the wall, where it hung, with a <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref806">sound of sinister omen</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">All his pent-up wrath burst forth in a sudden explosion,</div>
<div class="verse">Even as a <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref807">hand-grenade</a>, that scatters destruction around it.</div>
<div class="verse">Wildly he shouted, and loud: “John Alden! you have betrayed me!</div>
<div class="verse">Me, Miles Standish, your friend! have supplanted, defrauded, betrayed me!</div>
<div class="verse">One of my ancestors ran his sword through the heart of Wat Tyler;</div>
<div class="verse">Who shall prevent me from running my own through the heart of a traitor?</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Yours is the greater treason, for yours is a treason to friendship!</div>
<div class="verse">You, who lived under my roof, whom I cherished and loved as a brother;</div>
<div class="verse">You, who have fed at my board, and drunk at my cup, to whose keeping</div>
<div class="verse">I have intrusted my honor, my thoughts the most sacred and secret—</div>
<div class="verse">You too, Brutus! ah woe to the name of friendship hereafter!</div>
<div class="verse">Brutus was Cæsar’s friend, and you were mine, but henceforward</div>
<div class="verse">Let there be nothing between us save war, and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref808">implacable hatred</a>!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">So spake the Captain of Plymouth, and strode about in the chamber,</div>
<div class="verse">Chafing and choking with rage; like cords were the veins on his temples.</div>
<div class="verse">But in the midst of his anger a man appeared at the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing in uttermost haste a message of urgent importance,</div>
<div class="verse">Rumors of danger and war and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref809">hostile incursions</a> of Indians!</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway the Captain paused, and, without further question or parley,</div>
<div class="verse">Took from the nail on the wall his sword with its scabbard of iron,</div>
<div class="verse">Buckled the belt round his waist, and, frowning fiercely, departed.</div>
<div class="verse">Alden was left alone. He heard the clank of the scabbard</div>
<div class="verse">Growing fainter and fainter, and dying away in the distance.</div>
<div class="verse">Then he arose from his seat, and looked forth into the darkness,</div>
<div class="verse">Felt the cool air blow on his cheek, that was hot with the insult,</div>
<div class="verse">Lifted his eyes to the heavens, and, folding his hands as in childhood,</div>
<div class="verse">Prayed in the silence of night to the Father who seeth in secret.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Meanwhile the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref810">choleric Captain</a> strode wrathful away to the council,</div>
<div class="verse">Found it already assembled, impatiently waiting his coming;</div>
<div class="verse">Men in the middle of life, austere and grave in deportment,</div>
<div class="verse">Only one of them old, the hill that was nearest to heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">Covered with snow, but erect, the excellent Elder of Plymouth.</div>
<div class="verse">God had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Then had sifted the wheat, as the living seed of a nation;</div>
<div class="verse">So say the chronicles old, and such is the faith of the people!</div>
<div class="verse">Near them was standing an Indian, in attitude stern and defiant,</div>
<div class="verse">Naked down to the waist, and grim and ferocious in aspect;</div>
<div class="verse">While on the table before them was lying unopened a Bible,</div>
<div class="verse">Ponderous, bound in leather, brass-studded, printed in Holland,</div>
<div class="verse">And beside it outstretched the skin of a rattlesnake glittered,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled, like a quiver, with arrows; a signal and challenge of warfare,</div>
<div class="verse">Brought by the Indian, and speaking with arrowy tongues of defiance.</div>
<div class="verse">This Miles Standish beheld, as he entered, and heard them debating</div>
<div class="verse">What were an answer befitting the hostile message and menace,</div>
<div class="verse">Talking of this and that, contriving, suggesting, objecting;</div>
<div class="verse">One voice only for peace, and that the voice of the Elder,</div>
<div class="verse">Judging it wise and well that some at least were converted,</div>
<div class="verse">Rather than any were slain, for this was but Christian behavior!</div>
<div class="verse">Then outspoke Miles Standish, the stalwart Captain of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Muttering deep in his throat, for his voice was husky with anger:</div>
<div class="verse">“What! do you mean to make war with milk and the water of roses?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it to shoot red squirrels you have your howitzer planted</div>
<div class="verse">There on the roof of the church, or is it to shoot red devils?</div>
<div class="verse">Truly the only tongue that is understood by a savage</div>
<div class="verse">Must be the tongue of fire that speaks from the mouth of the cannon!”</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered and said the excellent Elder of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat amazed and alarmed at this irreverent language:</div>
<div class="verse">“Not so thought St. Paul, nor yet the other Apostles;</div>
<div class="verse">Not from the cannon’s mouth were the tongues of fire they spake with!”</div>
<div class="verse">But unheeded fell this mild rebuke on the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Who had advanced to the table, and thus continued discoursing:</div>
<div class="verse">“Leave this matter to me, for to me by right it pertaineth.</div>
<div class="verse">War is a terrible trade; but in the cause that is righteous,</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet is the smell of powder; and thus I answer the challenge!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Then from the rattlesnake’s skin, with a sudden, contemptuous gesture,</div>
<div class="verse">Jerking the Indian arrows, he filled it with powder and bullets</div>
<div class="verse">Full to the very jaws, and handed it back to the savage,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, in thundering tones: “Here, take it! this is your answer!”</div>
<div class="verse">Silently out of the room then glided the glistening savage,</div>
<div class="verse">Bearing the serpent’s skin, and seeming himself like a serpent,</div>
<div class="verse">Winding his <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref811">sinuous way</a> in the dark to the depths of the forest.</div>

<h5>THE SAILING OF THE MAY FLOWER</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Just in the gray of the dawn, as the mists uprose from the meadows,</div>
<div class="verse">There was a stir and a sound in the slumbering village of Plymouth;</div>
<div class="verse">Clanging and clicking of arms, and the order imperative, “Forward!”</div>
<div class="verse">Given in tone suppressed, a tramp of feet, and then silence.</div>
<div class="verse">Figures ten, in the mist, marched slowly out of the village.</div>
<div class="verse">Standish the stalwart it was, with eight of his valorous army,</div>
<div class="verse">Led by their Indian guide, by Hobomok, friend of the white men,</div>
<div class="verse">Northward marching to quell the sudden revolt of the savage.</div>
<div class="verse">Giants they seemed in the mist, or the mighty men of King David;</div>
<div class="verse">Giants in heart they were, who believed in God and the Bible—</div>
<div class="verse">Ay, who believed in the smiting of Midianites and Philistines.</div>
<div class="verse">Over them gleamed far off the crimson banners of morning;</div>
<div class="verse">Under them loud on the sands, the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref812">serried billows</a>, advancing,</div>
<div class="verse">Fired along the line, and in regular order retreated.</div>
<div class="verse">Many a mile had they marched, when at length the village of Plymouth</div>
<div class="verse">Woke from its sleep, and arose, intent on its manifold labors.</div>
<div class="verse">Sweet was the air and soft, and slowly the smoke from the chimneys</div>
<div class="verse">Rose over roofs of thatch, and pointed steadily eastward;</div>
<div class="verse">Men came forth from the doors, and paused and talked of the weather,</div>
<div class="verse">Said that the wind had changed, and was blowing fair for the May Flower;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Talked of their Captain’s departure, and all the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref813">dangers that menaced</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">He being gone, the town, and what should be done in his absence.</div>
<div class="verse">Merrily sang the birds, and the tender voices of women</div>
<div class="verse">Consecrated with hymns the common cares of the household.</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the sea rose the sun, and the billows rejoiced at his coming;</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful were his feet on the purple tops of the mountains;</div>
<div class="verse">Beautiful on the sails of the May Flower riding at anchor,</div>
<div class="verse">Battered and blackened and worn by all the storms of the winter.</div>
<div class="verse">Loosely against her masts was hanging and flapping her canvas,</div>
<div class="verse">Rent by so many gales, and patched by the hands of the sailors.</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly from her side, as the sun rose over the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Darted a puff of smoke, and floated seaward; anon rang</div>
<div class="verse">Loud over field and forest the cannon’s roar, and the echoes</div>
<div class="verse">Heard and repeated the sound, the signal-gun of departure!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! but with louder echoes replied the hearts of the people!</div>
<div class="verse">Meekly, in voices subdued, the chapter was read from the Bible,</div>
<div class="verse">Meekly the prayer was begun, but ended in fervent entreaty!</div>
<div class="verse">Then from their houses in haste came forth the Pilgrims of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">Men and women and children, all hurrying down to the seashore,</div>
<div class="verse">Eager, with tearful eyes, to say farewell to the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward bound o’er the sea, and leaving them here in the desert.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Foremost among them was Alden. All night he had lain without slumber,</div>
<div class="verse">Turning and tossing about in the heat and unrest of his fever.</div>
<div class="verse">He had beheld Miles Standish, who came back late from the council,</div>
<div class="verse">Stalking into the room, and heard him mutter and murmur;</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes it seemed a prayer, and sometimes it sounded like swearing.</div>
<div class="verse">Once he had come to the bed, and stood there a moment in silence;</div>
<div class="verse">Then he had turned away, and said: “I will not awake him;</div>
<div class="verse">Let him sleep on, it is best; for what is the use of more talking!”</div>
<div class="verse">Then he extinguished the light, and threw himself down on his pallet.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Dressed as he was, and ready to start at the break of the morning—</div>
<div class="verse">Covered himself with the cloak he had worn in his campaigns in Flanders—</div>
<div class="verse">Slept as a soldier sleeps in his bivouac, ready for action.</div>
<div class="verse">But with the dawn he arose; in the twilight Alden beheld him</div>
<div class="verse">Put on his corselet of steel, and all the rest of his armor,</div>
<div class="verse">Buckle about his waist his trusty blade of Damascus,</div>
<div class="verse">Take from the corner his musket, and so stride out of the chamber.</div>
<div class="verse">Often the heart of the youth had burned and yearned to embrace him,</div>
<div class="verse">Often his lips had essayed to speak, imploring for pardon,</div>
<div class="verse">All the old friendship came back, with its tender and grateful emotions.</div>
<div class="verse">But his pride overmastered the noble nature within him—</div>
<div class="verse">Pride, and the sense of his wrong, and the burning fire of the insult.</div>
<div class="verse">So he beheld his friend departing in anger, but spake not,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw him go forth to danger, perhaps to death, and he spake not!</div>
<div class="verse">Then he arose from his bed, and heard what the people were saying,</div>
<div class="verse">Joined in the talk at the door, with Stephen and Richard and Gilbert,</div>
<div class="verse">Joined in the morning prayer, and in the reading of Scripture,</div>
<div class="verse">And, with the others, in haste went hurrying down to the seashore,</div>
<div class="verse">Down to the Plymouth Rock, that had been to their feet as a doorstep</div>
<div class="verse">Into a world unknown—the corner-stone of a nation!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">There with his boat was the Master, already a little impatient</div>
<div class="verse">Lest he should <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref814">lose the tide</a>, or the wind might shift to the eastward,</div>
<div class="verse">Square-built, hearty, and strong, with an odor of ocean about him,</div>
<div class="verse">Speaking with this one and that, and cramming letters and parcels</div>
<div class="verse">Into his pockets capacious, and messages mingled together</div>
<div class="verse">Into his narrow brain, till at last he was wholly bewildered.</div>
<div class="verse">Nearer the boat stood Alden, with one foot placed on the gunwale,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
<div class="verse">One still firm on the rock, and talking at times with the sailors,</div>
<div class="verse">Seated erect <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref815">on the thwarts</a>, all ready and eager for starting.</div>
<div class="verse">He too was eager to go, and thus put an end to his anguish,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking to fly from despair, that swifter than keel is or canvas,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking to drown in the sea the ghost that would rise and pursue him.</div>
<div class="verse">But as he gazed on the crowd, he beheld the form of Priscilla</div>
<div class="verse">Standing dejected among them, unconscious of all that was passing.</div>
<div class="verse">Fixed were her eyes upon his, as if she <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref816">divined his intention</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Fixed with a look so sad, so reproachful, imploring, and patient,</div>
<div class="verse">That with a sudden revulsion his heart recoiled from its purpose,</div>
<div class="verse">As from the verge of a crag, where one step more is destruction.</div>
<div class="verse">Strange is the heart of man, with its quick, mysterious instincts!</div>
<div class="verse">Strange is the life of man, and fatal or fated are moments,</div>
<div class="verse">Whereupon turn, as on hinges, the gates of the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref817">wall adamantine</a>!</div>
<div class="verse">“Here I remain!” he exclaimed, as he looked at the heavens above him,</div>
<div class="verse">Thanking the Lord whose breath had scattered the mist and the madness,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein, blind and lost, to death he was staggering headlong.</div>
<div class="verse">“Yonder snow-white cloud, that floats in the ether above me,</div>
<div class="verse">Seems like a hand that is pointing and beckoning over the ocean.</div>
<div class="verse">There is another hand, that is not so spectral and ghost-like,</div>
<div class="verse">Holding me, drawing me back, and clasping mine for protection.</div>
<div class="verse">Float, O hand of cloud, and vanish away in the ether!</div>
<div class="verse">Roll thyself up like a fist, to threaten and daunt me; I heed not</div>
<div class="verse">Either your warning or menace, or any omen of evil!</div>
<div class="verse">There is no land so sacred, nor air so pure and so wholesome,</div>
<div class="verse">As is the air she breathes, and the soil that is pressed by her footsteps.</div>
<div class="verse">Here for her sake will I stay, and like an invisible presence</div>
<div class="verse">Hover around her forever, protecting, supporting her weakness;</div>
<div class="verse">Yes! as my foot was the first that stepped on this rock at the landing,</div>
<div class="verse">So, with the blessing of God, shall it be the last at the leaving!”</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Meanwhile the Master alert, but with dignified air and important,</div>
<div class="verse">Scanning with watchful eye the tide and the wind and the weather,</div>
<div class="verse">Walked about on the sands; and the people crowded around him</div>
<div class="verse">Saying a few last words, and enforcing his careful remembrance.</div>
<div class="verse">Then, taking each by the hand, as if he were <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref818">grasping a tiller</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the boat he sprang, and in haste shoved off to his vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Glad in his heart to get rid of all this worry and flurry,</div>
<div class="verse">Glad to be gone from a land of sand and sickness and sorrow,</div>
<div class="verse">Short allowance of victual, and plenty of nothing but Gospel!</div>
<div class="verse">Lost in the sound of the oars was the last farewell of the Pilgrims.</div>
<div class="verse">O strong hearts and true! not one went back in the May Flower!</div>
<div class="verse">No, not one looked back, who had set his hand to this plowing!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Soon were heard on board the shouts and songs of the sailors</div>
<div class="verse"><a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref819">Heaving the windlass round</a>, and hoisting the ponderous anchor.</div>
<div class="verse">Then the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref820">yards were braced</a>, and all sails set to the west-wind,</div>
<div class="verse">Blowing steady and strong; and the May Flower sailed from the harbor,</div>
<div class="verse">Rounded the point of the Gurnet, and leaving far to the southward</div>
<div class="verse">Island and cape of sand, and the Field of the First Encounter,</div>
<div class="verse">Took the wind on her quarter, and stood for the open Atlantic,</div>
<div class="verse">Borne on the send of the sea, and the swelling hearts of the Pilgrims.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Long in silence they watched the receding sail of the vessel,</div>
<div class="verse">Much endeared to them all, as something living and human;</div>
<div class="verse">Then, as if filled with the spirit, and wrapt in a vision prophetic,</div>
<div class="verse">Baring his hoary head, the excellent Elder of Plymouth</div>
<div class="verse">Said, “Let us pray!” and they prayed and thanked the Lord and took courage.</div>
<div class="verse">Mournfully sobbed the waves at the base of the rock, and above them</div>
<div class="verse">Bowed and whispered the wheat on the hill of death, and their kindred</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed to awake in their graves, and to join in the prayer that they uttered.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Sun-illumined and white, on the eastern verge of the ocean</div>
<div class="verse">Gleamed the departing sail, like a marble slab in a graveyard;</div>
<div class="verse">Buried beneath it lay forever all hope of escaping.</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! as they turned to depart, they saw the form of an Indian,</div>
<div class="verse">Watching them from the hill; but while they spake with each other,</div>
<div class="verse">Pointing with outstretched hands, and saying, “Look!” he had vanished.</div>
<div class="verse">So they returned to their homes; but Alden lingered a little,</div>
<div class="verse">Musing alone on the shore, and watching the wash of the billows</div>
<div class="verse">Round the base of the rock, and the sparkle and flash of the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the spirit of God, moving visibly over the waters.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<h5>PRISCILLA</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Thus for a while he stood, and mused by the shore of the ocean,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking of many things, and most of all of Priscilla;</div>
<div class="verse">And as if thought had the power to draw to itself, like the load-stone,</div>
<div class="verse">Whatsoever it touches, by subtle laws of its nature,</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! as he turned to depart, Priscilla was standing beside him.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“Are you so much offended you will not speak to me?” said she.</div>
<div class="verse">“Am I so much to blame, that yesterday, when you were pleading</div>
<div class="verse">Warmly the cause of another, my heart, impulsive and wayward,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleaded your own, and spake out, forgetful perhaps of decorum?</div>
<div class="verse">Certainly you can forgive me for speaking so frankly, for saying</div>
<div class="verse">What I ought not to have said, yet now I can never unsay it;</div>
<div class="verse">For there are moments in life, when the heart is so full of emotion,</div>
<div class="verse">That if by chance it be shaken, or into its depths like a pebble</div>
<div class="verse">Drops some careless word, it overflows, and its secret,</div>
<div class="verse">Spilt on the ground like water, can never be gathered together.</div>
<div class="verse">Yesterday I was shocked, when I heard you speak of Miles Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising his virtues, transforming his very defects into virtues,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising his courage and strength, and even his fighting in Flanders,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
<div class="verse">As if by fighting alone you could win the heart of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">Quite overlooking yourself and the rest, in exalting your hero.</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore I spake as I did, by an <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref821">irresistible impulse</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">You will forgive me, I hope, for the sake of the friendship between us,</div>
<div class="verse">Which is too true and too sacred to be so easily broken!”</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, the scholar, the friend of Miles Standish:</div>
<div class="verse">“I was not angry with you, with myself alone I was angry,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing how badly I managed the matter I had in my keeping.”</div>
<div class="verse">“No!” interrupted the maiden, with answer prompt and decisive;</div>
<div class="verse">“No; you are angry with me, for speaking so frankly and freely.</div>
<div class="verse">It was wrong, I acknowledge; for it is the fate of a woman</div>
<div class="verse">Long to be patient and silent, to wait like a ghost that is speechless,</div>
<div class="verse">Till some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.</div>
<div class="verse">Hence is the inner life of so many suffering women</div>
<div class="verse">Sunless and silent and deep, like <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref822">subterranean rivers</a></div>
<div class="verse">Running through caverns of darkness, unheard, unseen, and unfruitful,</div>
<div class="verse">Chafing their channels of stone, with endless and profitless murmurs.”</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, the young man, the lover of women:</div>
<div class="verse">“Heaven forbid it, Priscilla; and truly they seem to me always</div>
<div class="verse">More like the beautiful rivers that watered the garden of Eden.</div>
<div class="verse">More like the river Euphrates, through deserts of Havilah flowing,</div>
<div class="verse">Filling the land with delight, and memories sweet of the garden!”</div>
<div class="verse">“Ah, by these words, I can see,” again interrupted the maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">“How very little you prize me, or care for what I am saying.</div>
<div class="verse">When from the depths of my heart, in pain and with secret misgiving,</div>
<div class="verse">Frankly I speak to you, asking for sympathy only and kindness,</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway you take up my words, that are plain and direct and in earnest,</div>
<div class="verse">Turn them away from their meaning, and answer with flattering phrases.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
<div class="verse">This is not right, is not just, is not true to the best that is in you;</div>
<div class="verse">For I know and esteem you, and feel that your nature is noble,</div>
<div class="verse">Lifting mine up to a higher, <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref823">a more ethereal level</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">Therefore I value your friendship, and feel it perhaps the more keenly</div>
<div class="verse">If you say aught that implies I am only as one among many,</div>
<div class="verse">If you make use of those common and complimentary phrases</div>
<div class="verse">Most men think so fine, in dealing and speaking with women,</div>
<div class="verse">But which women reject as insipid, if not as insulting.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Mute and amazed was Alden; and listened and looked at Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Thinking he never had seen her more fair, more divine in her beauty.</div>
<div class="verse">He who but yesterday pleaded so glibly the cause of another,</div>
<div class="verse">Stood there embarrassed and silent, and seeking in vain for an answer.</div>
<div class="verse">So the maiden went on, and little divined or imagined</div>
<div class="verse">What was at work in his heart, that made him so awkward and speechless.</div>
<div class="verse">“Let us, then, be what we are, and speak what we think, and in all things</div>
<div class="verse">Keep ourselves loyal to truth, and the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref824">sacred professions</a> of friendship.</div>
<div class="verse">It is no secret I tell you, nor am I ashamed to declare it:</div>
<div class="verse">I have liked to be with you, to see you, to speak with you always.</div>
<div class="verse">So I was hurt at your words, and a little affronted to hear you</div>
<div class="verse">Urge me to marry your friend, though he were the Captain Miles Standish.</div>
<div class="verse">For I must tell you the truth: much more to me is your friendship</div>
<div class="verse">Than all the love he could give, were he twice the hero you think him.”</div>
<div class="verse">Then she extended her hand, and Alden, who eagerly grasped it,</div>
<div class="verse">Felt all the wounds in his heart, that were aching and bleeding so sorely,</div>
<div class="verse">Healed by the touch of that hand, and he said, with a voice full of feeling:</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
<div class="verse">“Yes, we must ever be friends; and of all who offer you friendship</div>
<div class="verse">Let me be ever the first, the truest, the nearest and dearest!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Casting a farewell look at the glimmering sail of the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">Distant, but still in sight, and sinking below the horizon,</div>
<div class="verse">Homeward together they walked, with a strange, indefinite feeling,</div>
<div class="verse">That all the rest had departed and left them alone in the desert.</div>
<div class="verse">But, as they went through the fields in the blessing and smile of the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Lighter grew their hearts, and Priscilla said very archly:</div>
<div class="verse">“Now that our terrible Captain has gone in pursuit of the Indians,</div>
<div class="verse">Where he is happier far than he would be commanding a household,</div>
<div class="verse">You may speak boldly, and tell me of all that happened between you,</div>
<div class="verse">When you returned last night, and said how ungrateful you found me.”</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered John Alden, and told her the whole of the story—</div>
<div class="verse">Told her his own despair, and the direful wrath of Miles Standish.</div>
<div class="verse">Whereat the maiden smiled, and said between laughing and earnest,</div>
<div class="verse">“He is a little chimney, and heated hot in a moment!”</div>
<div class="verse">But as he gently rebuked her, and told her how much he had suffered—</div>
<div class="verse">How he had even determined to sail that day in the May Flower,</div>
<div class="verse">And had remained for her sake, on hearing the dangers that threatened—</div>
<div class="verse">All her manner was changed, and she said with a faltering accent,</div>
<div class="verse">“Truly I thank you for this; how good you have been to me always!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Thus, as a pilgrim devout, who toward Jerusalem journeys,</div>
<div class="verse">Taking three steps in advance, and one reluctantly backward,</div>
<div class="verse"><a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref825">Urged by importunate zeal</a>, and withheld by pangs of contrition;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Slowly but steadily onward, receding yet ever advancing,</div>
<div class="verse">Journeyed this Puritan youth to the Holy Land of his longings,</div>
<div class="verse">Urged by the fervor of love, and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref826">withheld by remorseful misgivings</a>.</div>

<h5>THE MARCH OF MILES STANDISH</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Meanwhile the stalwart Miles Standish was marching steadily northward,</div>
<div class="verse">Winding through forest and swamp, and along the trend of the seashore,</div>
<div class="verse">All day long, with hardly a halt, the fire of his anger</div>
<div class="verse">Burning and crackling within, and the sulphurous odor of powder</div>
<div class="verse">Seeming more sweet to his nostrils than all the scents of the forest.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent and moody he went, and much he revolved his discomfort;</div>
<div class="verse">He who was used to success, and to easy victories always,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref827">to be flouted</a>, rejected, and laughed to scorn by a maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to be mocked and betrayed by the friend whom most he had trusted!</div>
<div class="verse">Ah! ’twas too much to be borne, and he fretted and chafed in his armor!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">“I alone am to blame,” he muttered, “for mine was the folly.</div>
<div class="verse">What has a rough old soldier, grown grim and gray in the harness,</div>
<div class="verse">Used to the camp and its ways, to do with the wooing of maidens?</div>
<div class="verse">’Twas but a dream—let it pass—let it vanish like so many others!</div>
<div class="verse">What I thought was a flower, is only a weed, and is worthless;</div>
<div class="verse">Out of my heart will I pluck it, and throw it away, and henceforward</div>
<div class="verse">Be but a fighter of battles, a lover and wooer of dangers!”</div>
<div class="verse">Thus he revolved in his mind his sorry defeat and discomfort,</div>
<div class="verse">While he was marching by day or lying at night in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Looking up at the trees, and the constellations beyond them.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">After a three days’ march he came to an Indian encampment</div>
<div class="verse">Pitched on the edge of a meadow, between the sea and the forest;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Women at work by the tents, and the warriors, horrid with war-paint,</div>
<div class="verse">Seated about a fire, and smoking and talking together;</div>
<div class="verse">Who, when they saw from afar the sudden approach of the white men,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw the flash of the sun on breast-plate and saber and musket,</div>
<div class="verse">Straightway leaped to their feet, and two, from among them advancing,</div>
<div class="verse">Came to parley with Standish, and offer him furs as a present;</div>
<div class="verse">Friendship was in their looks, but in their hearts there was hatred.</div>
<div class="verse">Braves of the tribe were these, and brothers gigantic in stature,</div>
<div class="verse">Huge as Goliath of Gath, or the terrible Og, king of Bashan;</div>
<div class="verse">One was Pecksuot named, and the other was called Wattawamat.</div>
<div class="verse">Round their necks were suspended their knives in <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref828">scabbards of wampum</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Two-edged, <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref829">trenchant knives</a>, with points as sharp as a needle.</div>
<div class="verse">Other arms had they none, for they were cunning and crafty.</div>
<div class="verse">“Welcome, English!” they said—these words they had learned from the traders</div>
<div class="verse">Touching at times on the coast, to barter and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref830">chaffer for peltries</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">Then in their native tongue they began to parley with Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Through his guide and interpreter, Hobomok, friend of the white man,</div>
<div class="verse">Begging for blankets and knives, but mostly for muskets and powder,</div>
<div class="verse">Kept by the white man, they said, concealed, with the plague, in his cellars,</div>
<div class="verse">Ready to be let loose, and destroy his brother the red man!</div>
<div class="verse">But when Standish refused, and said he would give them the Bible,</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly changing their tone, they began to boast and to bluster.</div>
<div class="verse">Then Wattawamat advanced with a stride in front of the other,</div>
<div class="verse">And, with a lofty demeanor, thus vauntingly spake to the Captain:</div>
<div class="verse">“Now Wattawamat can see, by the fiery eyes of the Captain,</div>
<div class="verse">Angry is he in his heart; but the heart of the brave Wattawamat</div>
<div class="verse">Is not afraid at the sight. He was not born of a woman,</div>
<div class="verse">But on a mountain, at night, from an oak-tree riven by lightning,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Forth he sprang at a bound, with all his weapons about him,</div>
<div class="verse">Shouting, ‘Who is there here to fight with the brave Wattawamat?’”</div>
<div class="verse">Then he unsheathed his knife, and, whetting the blade on his left hand,</div>
<div class="verse">Held it aloft and displayed a woman’s face on the handle,</div>
<div class="verse">Saying, with bitter expression and look of <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref831">sinister meaning</a>:</div>
<div class="verse">“I have another at home, with the face of a man on the handle;</div>
<div class="verse">By and by they shall marry; and there will be plenty of children!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Then stood Pecksuot forth, self-vaunting, insulting Miles Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">While with his fingers he patted the knife that hung at his bosom,</div>
<div class="verse">Drawing it half from its sheath, and plunging it back, as he muttered:</div>
<div class="verse">“By and by it shall see; it shall eat; ah, ha! but shall speak not!</div>
<div class="verse">This is the mighty Captain the white men have sent to destroy us!</div>
<div class="verse">He is a little man; let him go and work with the women!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Meanwhile Standish had noted the faces and figures of Indians</div>
<div class="verse">Peeping and creeping about from bush to tree in the forest,</div>
<div class="verse">Feigning to look for game, with arrows set on their bow-strings,</div>
<div class="verse">Drawing about him still closer and closer the net of their ambush.</div>
<div class="verse">But undaunted he stood, and dissembled and treated them smoothly;</div>
<div class="verse">So the old chronicles say, that were writ in the days of the fathers.</div>
<div class="verse">But when he heard their defiance, the boast, the taunt, and the insult,</div>
<div class="verse">All the hot blood of his race, of Sir Hugh and of Thurston de Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Boiled and beat in his heart, and swelled in the veins of his temples.</div>
<div class="verse">Headlong he leaped on the boaster, and, snatching his knife from its scabbard,</div>
<div class="verse">Plunged it into his heart, and, reeling backward, the savage</div>
<div class="verse">Fell with his face to the sky, and a fiendlike fierceness upon it.</div>
<div class="verse">Straight there arose from the forest the awful sound of the war-whoop,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
<div class="verse">And, like a flurry of snow on the whistling wind of December,</div>
<div class="verse">Swift and sudden and keen came a flight of feathery arrows.</div>
<div class="verse">Then came a cloud of smoke, and out of the cloud came the lightning,</div>
<div class="verse">Out of the lightning thunder; and death unseen ran before it.</div>
<div class="verse">Frightened, the savages fled for shelter in swamp and in thicket.</div>
<div class="verse">Hotly pursued and beset; but their sachem, the brave Wattawamat,</div>
<div class="verse">Fled not; he was dead. Unswerving and swift had a bullet</div>
<div class="verse">Passed through his brain, and he fell with both hands clutching the greensward,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeming in death to hold back from his foe the land of his fathers.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">There on the flowers of the meadow the warriors lay, and above them,</div>
<div class="verse">Silent, with folded arms, stood Hobomok, friend of the white man.</div>
<div class="verse">Smiling at length, he exclaimed to the stalwart Captain of Plymouth:</div>
<div class="verse">“Pecksuot bragged very loud, of his courage, his strength, and his stature—</div>
<div class="verse">Mocked the great Captain, and called him a little man; but I see now</div>
<div class="verse">Big enough have you been to lay him speechless before you!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Thus the first battle was fought and won by the stalwart Miles Standish.</div>
<div class="verse">When the tidings thereof were brought to the village of Plymouth,</div>
<div class="verse">And as a trophy of war the head of the brave Wattawamat</div>
<div class="verse">Scowled from the roof of the fort, which at once was a church and a fortress,</div>
<div class="verse">All who beheld it rejoiced, and praised the Lord, and took courage.</div>
<div class="verse">Only Priscilla averted her face from this specter of terror.</div>
<div class="verse">Thanking God in her heart that she had not married Miles Standish;</div>
<div class="verse">Shrinking, fearing almost, lest, coming home from his battles,</div>
<div class="verse">He should lay claim to her hand, as the prize and reward of his valor.</div>

<h5>THE SPINNING-WHEEL</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Month after month passed away, and in autumn the ships of the merchants</div>
<div class="verse">Came with kindred and friends, with cattle and corn for the Pilgrims.</div>
<div class="verse">All in the village was peace; the men were intent on their labors,</div>
<div class="verse">Busy with hewing and building, with garden-plot and with merestead,</div>
<div class="verse">Busy with <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref832">breaking the glebe</a>, and mowing the grass in the meadows,</div>
<div class="verse">Searching the sea for its fish, and hunting the deer in the forest.</div>
<div class="verse">All in the village was peace; but at times the rumor of warfare</div>
<div class="verse">Filled the air with alarm, and the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref833">apprehension of danger</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">Bravely the stalwart Miles Standish was scouring the land with his forces,</div>
<div class="verse">Waxing valiant in fight and defeating the alien armies,</div>
<div class="verse">Till his name had become a sound of fear to the nations.</div>
<div class="verse">Anger was still in his heart, but at times the remorse and contrition</div>
<div class="verse">Which in all noble natures succeed the passionate outbreak,</div>
<div class="verse">Came like a rising tide, that encounters the rush of a river,</div>
<div class="verse">Staying its current awhile, but making it bitter and brackish.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Meanwhile Alden at home had built him a new habitation.</div>
<div class="verse">Solid, substantial, of <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref834">timber roughhewn</a> from the firs of the forest.</div>
<div class="verse">Wooden-barred was the door, and the roof was covered with rushes;</div>
<div class="verse">Latticed the windows were, and the window-panes were of paper,</div>
<div class="verse">Oiled to admit the light, while wind and rain were excluded.</div>
<div class="verse">There too he dug a well, and around it planted an orchard;</div>
<div class="verse">Still may be seen to this day some trace of the well and the orchard.</div>
<div class="verse">Close to the house was the stall, where, safe and secure from annoyance,</div>
<div class="verse">Raghorn, the snow-white bull, that had fallen to <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref835">Alden’s allotment</a></div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
<div class="verse">In the division of cattle, might ruminate in the night-time</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Oft when his labor was finished, with eager feet would the dreamer</div>
<div class="verse">Follow the pathway that ran through the woods to the house of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse"><a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref836">Led by illusions</a> romantic and <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref837">subtle deceptions of fancy</a>,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleasure disguised as duty, and love in the semblance of friendship.</div>
<div class="verse">Ever of her he thought, when he fashioned the walls of his dwelling;</div>
<div class="verse">Ever of her he thought, when he delved in the soil of his garden;</div>
<div class="verse">Ever of her he thought, when he read in his Bible on Sunday</div>
<div class="verse">Praise of the virtuous woman, as she is described in the Proverbs—</div>
<div class="verse">How the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her always,</div>
<div class="verse">How all the days of her life she will do him good, and not evil,</div>
<div class="verse">How she seeketh the wool and the flax and worketh with gladness,</div>
<div class="verse">How she layeth her hand to the spindle and holdeth the distaff,</div>
<div class="verse">How she is not afraid of the snow for herself or her household,</div>
<div class="verse">Knowing her household are clothed with the scarlet cloth of her weaving!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">So as she sat at her wheel one afternoon in the Autumn,</div>
<div class="verse">Alden, who opposite sat, and was watching her dexterous fingers,</div>
<div class="verse">As if the thread she was spinning were that of his life and his fortune,</div>
<div class="verse">After a pause in their talk, thus spake to the sound of the spindle.</div>
<div class="verse">“Truly, Priscilla,” he said, “when I see you spinning and spinning,</div>
<div class="verse">Never idle a moment, but thrifty and thoughtful of others,</div>
<div class="verse">Suddenly you are transformed, are visibly changed in a moment;</div>
<div class="verse">You are no longer Priscilla, but Bertha the Beautiful Spinner.”</div>
<div class="verse">Here the light foot on the treadle grew swifter and swifter; the spindle</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Uttered an angry snarl, and the thread snapped short in her fingers;</div>
<div class="verse">While the impetuous speaker, not heeding the mischief, continued:</div>
<div class="verse">“You are the beautiful Bertha, the spinner, the queen of Helvetia;</div>
<div class="verse">She whose story I read at a stall in the streets of Southampton,</div>
<div class="verse">Who, as she rode on her palfrey, o’er valley and meadow and mountain,</div>
<div class="verse">Ever was spinning her thread from a distaff fixed to her saddle.</div>
<div class="verse">She was so thrifty and good that her name passed into a proverb.</div>
<div class="verse">So shall it be with your own, when the spinning-wheel shall no longer</div>
<div class="verse">Hum in the house of the farmer, and fill its chambers with music.</div>
<div class="verse">Then shall the mothers, reproving, relate how it was in their childhood,</div>
<div class="verse">Praising the good old times, and the days of Priscilla the spinner!”</div>
<div class="verse">Straight uprose from her wheel the beautiful Puritan maiden,</div>
<div class="verse">Pleased with the praise of her thrift from him whose praise was the sweetest,</div>
<div class="verse">Drew from the reel on the table a snowy skein of her spinning,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus making answer, meanwhile, to the flattering phrases of Alden:</div>
<div class="verse">“Come, you must not be idle; if I am a pattern for housewives,</div>
<div class="verse">Show yourself equally worthy of being the model of husbands.</div>
<div class="verse">Hold this skein on your hands, while I wind it, ready for knitting;</div>
<div class="verse">Then who knows but hereafter, when fashions have changed and the manners,</div>
<div class="verse">Fathers may talk to their sons of the good old times of John Alden!”</div>
<div class="verse">Thus, with a jest and a laugh, the skein on his hands she adjusted,</div>
<div class="verse">He sitting awkwardly there, with his arms extended before him,</div>
<div class="verse">She standing graceful, erect, and winding the thread from his fingers,</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes chiding a little his clumsy manner of holding,</div>
<div class="verse">Sometimes touching his hands, as she disentangled expertly</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Twist or knot in the yarn, unawares—for how could she help it?—</div>
<div class="verse">Sending electrical thrills through every nerve in his body.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Lo! in the midst of this scene, a breathless messenger entered,</div>
<div class="verse">Bringing in hurry and heat the terrible news from the village.</div>
<div class="verse">Yes; Miles Standish was dead!—an Indian had brought them the tidings—</div>
<div class="verse">Slain by a poisoned arrow, shot down in the front of the battle,</div>
<div class="verse"><a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref838">Into an ambush beguiled</a>, cut off with the whole of his forces;</div>
<div class="verse">All the town would be burned, and all the people be murdered!</div>
<div class="verse">Such were the tidings of evil that burst on the hearts of the hearers.</div>
<div class="verse">Silent and statue-like stood Priscilla, her face looking backward</div>
<div class="verse">Still at the face of the speaker, her arms uplifted in horror;</div>
<div class="verse">But John Alden, upstarting, as if the barb of the arrow</div>
<div class="verse">Piercing the heart of his friend had struck his own, and had sundered</div>
<div class="verse">Once and forever the bonds that held him bound as a captive,</div>
<div class="verse">Wild with excess of sensation, the awful delight of his freedom,</div>
<div class="verse">Mingled with pain and regret, unconscious of what he was doing.</div>
<div class="verse">Clasped, almost with a groan, the motionless form of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Pressing her close to his heart, as forever his own, and exclaiming:</div>
<div class="verse">“Those whom the Lord hath united, let no man put them asunder!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Even as rivulets twain, from distant and separate sources,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeing each other afar, as they leap from the rocks, and pursuing</div>
<div class="verse">Each one its devious path, but drawing nearer and nearer,</div>
<div class="verse">Rush together at last, at their <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref839">trysting-place</a> in the forest;</div>
<div class="verse">So these lives that had run thus far in separate channels,</div>
<div class="verse">Coming in sight of each other, then swerving and flowing asunder,</div>
<div class="verse">Parted by barriers strong, but drawing nearer and nearer,</div>
<div class="verse">Rushed together at last, and one was lost in the other.</div>

<h5>THE WEDDING DAY</h5>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Forth from the curtain of clouds, from the tent of purple and scarlet,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Issued the sun, the great High-Priest, in his garments resplendent,</div>
<div class="verse">Holiness unto the Lord, in letters of light, on his forehead,</div>
<div class="verse">Round the hem of his robe the golden bells and pomegranates.</div>
<div class="verse">Blessing the world he came, and the bars of vapor beneath him</div>
<div class="verse">Gleamed like a grate of brass, and the sea at his feet was a laver!</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">This was the wedding morn of Priscilla the Puritan maiden.</div>
<div class="verse">Friends were assembled together; the Elder and Magistrate also</div>
<div class="verse">Graced the scene with their presence, and stood like the Law and the Gospel,</div>
<div class="verse">One with the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref840">sanction of earth</a> and one with the blessing of heaven.</div>
<div class="verse">Simple and brief was the wedding, as that of Ruth and of Boaz.</div>
<div class="verse">Softly the youth and the maiden repeated the words of betrothal,</div>
<div class="verse">Taking each other for husband and wife in the Magistrate’s presence,</div>
<div class="verse">After the Puritan way, and the laudable custom of Holland.</div>
<div class="verse">Fervently then, and devoutly, the excellent Elder of Plymouth</div>
<div class="verse">Prayed for the hearth and the home, that were founded that day in affection,</div>
<div class="verse">Speaking of life and of death, and imploring divine benedictions.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Lo! when the service was ended, a form appeared on the threshold,</div>
<div class="verse">Clad in armor of steel, a somber and sorrowful figure!</div>
<div class="verse">Why does the bridegroom start and stare at the strange apparition?</div>
<div class="verse">Why does the bride turn pale, and hide her face on his shoulder?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it a phantom of air—<a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref841">a bodiless spectral illusion</a>?</div>
<div class="verse">Is it a ghost from the grave, that has come to forbid the betrothal?</div>
<div class="verse">Long had it stood there unseen, a guest uninvited, unwelcomed;</div>
<div class="verse">Over its clouded eyes there had passed at times an expression</div>
<div class="verse">Softening the gloom and revealing the warm heart hidden beneath them,</div>
<div class="verse">As when across the sky the <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref842">driving rack</a> of the rain-cloud</div>
<div class="verse">Grows for a moment thin, and betrays the sun by its brightness.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Once it had lifted its hand, and moved its lips, but was silent,</div>
<div class="verse">As if an iron will had mastered the fleeting intention.</div>
<div class="verse">But when were ended the troth and the prayer and the last benediction,</div>
<div class="verse">Into the room it strode, and the people beheld with amazement</div>
<div class="verse">Bodily there in his armor Miles Standish, the Captain of Plymouth!</div>
<div class="verse">Grasping the bridegroom’s hand, he said with emotion, “Forgive me!</div>
<div class="verse">I have been angry and hurt—too long have I cherished the feeling;</div>
<div class="verse">I have been cruel and hard, but now, thank God! it is ended.</div>
<div class="verse">Mine is the same hot blood that leaped in the veins of Hugh Standish,</div>
<div class="verse">Sensitive, swift to resent, but as swift in <a href="#phrases71" title="List of phrases" id="ref843">atoning for error</a>.</div>
<div class="verse">Never so much as now was Miles Standish the friend of John Alden.”</div>
<div class="verse">Thereupon answered the bridegroom: “Let all be forgotten between us—</div>
<div class="verse">All save the dear old friendship, and that shall grow older and dearer!”</div>
<div class="verse">Then the Captain advanced, and, bowing, saluted Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Gravely, and after the manner of old-fashioned gentry in England,</div>
<div class="verse">Something of camp and of court, of town and of country, commingled,</div>
<div class="verse">Wishing her joy of her wedding, and loudly lauding her husband.</div>
<div class="verse">Then he said with a smile: “I should have remembered the adage—</div>
<div class="verse">If you would be well served, you must serve yourself; and moreover,</div>
<div class="verse">No man can gather cherries in Kent at the season of Christmas!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Great was the people’s amazement, and greater yet their rejoicing,</div>
<div class="verse">Thus to behold once more the sunburnt face of their Captain,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Whom they had mourned as dead; and they gathered and crowded about him,</div>
<div class="verse">Eager to see him and hear him, forgetful of bride and of bridegroom,</div>
<div class="verse">Questioning, answering, laughing, and each interrupting the other,</div>
<div class="verse">Till the good Captain declared, being quite overpowered and bewildered,</div>
<div class="verse">He had rather by far break into an Indian encampment,</div>
<div class="verse">Than come again to a wedding to which he had not been invited.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Meanwhile the bridegroom went forth and stood with the bride at the doorway,</div>
<div class="verse">Breathing the perfumed air of that warm and beautiful morning.</div>
<div class="verse">Touched with autumnal tints, but lonely and sad in the sunshine,</div>
<div class="verse">Lay extended before them the land of toil and privation;</div>
<div class="verse">There were the graves of the dead, and the barren waste of the seashore,</div>
<div class="verse">There the familiar fields, the groves of pine, and the meadows;</div>
<div class="verse">But to their eyes transfigured, it seemed as the Garden of Eden,</div>
<div class="verse">Filled with the presence of God, whose voice was the sound of the ocean.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Soon was their vision disturbed by the noise and stir of departure,</div>
<div class="verse">Friends coming forth from the house, and impatient of longer delaying,</div>
<div class="verse">Each with his plan for the day, and the work that was left uncompleted.</div>
<div class="verse">Then from a stall near at hand, amid exclamations of wonder,</div>
<div class="verse">Alden the thoughtful, the careful, so happy, so proud of Priscilla,</div>
<div class="verse">Brought out his snow-white bull, obeying the hand of its master,</div>
<div class="verse">Led by a cord that was tied to an iron ring in its nostrils,</div>
<div class="verse">Covered with crimson cloth, and a cushion placed for a saddle.</div>
<div class="verse">She should not walk, he said, through the dust and heat of the noon-day;</div>
<div class="verse">Nay, she should ride like a queen, not plod along like a peasant.</div>
<div class="verse">Somewhat alarmed at first, but reassured by the others,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Placing her hand on the cushion, her foot in the hand of her husband,</div>
<div class="verse">Gayly, with joyous laugh, Priscilla mounted her palfrey.</div>
<div class="verse">“Nothing is wanting now,” he said, with a smile, “but the distaff;</div>
<div class="verse">Then you would be in truth my queen, my beautiful Bertha!”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Onward the bridal procession now moved to their new habitation,</div>
<div class="verse">Happy husband and wife, and friends conversing together.</div>

<h4>MY VISIT TO NIAGARA</h4>

<p class="author">NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</p>

<p>Never did a pilgrim approach Niagara with deeper enthusiasm
than mine. I had lingered away from it, and wandered to other
scenes, because my treasury of <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref845">anticipated enjoyments</a>, comprising
all the wonders of the world, had nothing else so magnificent, and I
was loath to exchange the pleasures of hope for those of memory so
soon. At length the day came. The stage-coach, with a Frenchman
and myself on the back seat, had already left Lewiston, and
in less than an hour would set us down in Manchester. I began to
listen for the roar of the cataract, and trembled with a sensation
like dread, as the moment drew nigh, when its voice of ages must
roll, for the first time, on my ear. The French gentleman stretched
himself from the window, and expressed loud admiration, while, by
a sudden impulse, I threw myself back and closed my eyes. When
the scene shut in, I was glad to think, that for me the whole burst
of Niagara was yet in futurity. We rolled on, and entered the
village of Manchester, bordering on the falls.</p>

<p>I am quite ashamed of myself here. Not that I ran like a
madman to the falls, and plunged into the thickest of the spray—never
stopping to breathe, till breathing was impossible; not that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
I committed this, or any other <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref846">suitable extravagance</a>. On the contrary,
I alighted with perfect decency and composure, gave my
cloak to the black waiter, pointed out my baggage, and inquired,
not the nearest way to the cataract, but about the dinner-hour.
The interval was spent in arranging my dress. Within the last
fifteen minutes, my mind had grown strangely benumbed, and my
spirits apathetic, with a slight depression, not decided enough to
be termed sadness. My enthusiasm was in a deathlike slumber.
Without aspiring to immortality, as he did, I could have imitated
that English traveler who turned back from the point where he
first heard the thunder of Niagara, after crossing the ocean to
behold it. Many a Western trader, by the by, has performed a
similar act of heroism with more heroic simplicity, deeming it no
such wonderful feat to dine at the hotel and resume his route to
Buffalo or Lewiston, while the cataract was roaring unseen.</p>

<p>Such has often been my apathy, when objects, long sought, and
earnestly desired, were placed within my reach. After dinner—at
which an unwonted and <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref847">perverse epicurism</a> detained me longer
than usual—I lighted a cigar and paced the piazza, minutely
attentive to the aspect and business of a very ordinary village.
Finally, with reluctant step, and the feeling of an intruder, I
walked toward Goat Island. At the toll-house, there were further
excuses for delaying the inevitable moment. My signature was
required in a huge ledger, containing similar records innumerable,
many of which I read. The skin of a great sturgeon, and other
fishes, beasts, and reptiles; a collection of minerals, such as lie in
heaps near the falls; some Indian moccasins, and other trifles,
made of deer-skin and embroidered with beads; several newspapers,
from Montreal, New York, and Boston—all attracted me
in turn. Out of a number of twisted sticks, the manufacture of a
Tuscarora Indian, I selected one of curled maple, curiously convoluted,
and adorned with the carved images of a snake and a fish.
Using this as my pilgrim’s staff, I crossed the bridge. Above and
below me were the rapids, a river of <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref848">impetuous snow</a>, with here
and there a dark rock amid its whiteness, resisting all the physical
fury, as any cold spirit did the moral influences of the scene. On
reaching Goat Island, which separates the two great segments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
the falls, I chose the right-hand path, and followed it to the edge
of the American cascade. There, while the falling sheet was yet
invisible, I saw the vapor that never vanishes, and the <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref849">Eternal
Rainbow</a> of Niagara.</p>

<p>It was an afternoon of glorious sunshine, without a cloud, save
those of the cataracts. I gained an <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref850">insulated rock</a>, and beheld a
broad sheet of brilliant and unbroken foam, not shooting in a
curved line from the top of the precipice, but falling headlong
down from height to depth. A narrow stream diverged from the
main branch, and hurried over the crag by a channel of its own,
leaving a little pine-clad island and a streak of precipice between
itself and the larger sheet. Below arose the mist, on which was
painted a dazzling sunbow with two concentric shadows—one,
almost as perfect as the original brightness; and the other, drawn
faintly round the broken edge of the cloud.</p>

<p>Still I had not half seen Niagara. Following the verge of the
island, the path led me to the Horseshoe, where the real, broad St.
Lawrence, rushing along on a level with its banks, pours its whole
breadth over a concave line of precipice, and thence pursues its
course between lofty crags toward Ontario. A sort of bridge, two
or three feet wide, stretches out along the edge of the descending
sheet, and hangs upon the rising mist, as if that were the foundation
of the frail structure. Here I stationed myself in the blast
of wind, which the rushing river bore along with it. The bridge
was tremulous beneath me, and marked the tremor of the solid
earth. I looked along the whitening rapids, and endeavored to
distinguish a mass of water far above the falls, to follow it to their
verge, and go down with it, in fancy, to the <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref851">abyss of clouds</a> and
storm. Casting my eyes across the river, and every side, I took in
the whole scene at a glance, and tried to comprehend it in one vast
idea. After an hour thus spent, I left the bridge, and by a stair-case,
winding almost interminably round a post, descended to the
base of the precipice. From that point, my path lay over slippery
stones, and among great fragments of the cliff, to the edge of the
cataract, where the wind at once enveloped me in spray, and perhaps
dashed the rainbow round me. Were my long desires fulfilled?
And had I seen Niagara?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, that I had never heard of Niagara till I beheld it! Blessed
were the wanderers of old, who heard its deep roar, sounding
through the woods, as the summons to an unknown wonder, and
approached its awful brink, in all the freshness of <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref852">native feeling</a>.
Had its own mysterious voice been the first to warn me of its
existence, then, indeed, I might have knelt down and worshiped.
But I had come thither, haunted with a vision of foam and fury,
and dizzy cliffs, and an ocean tumbling down out of the sky—a
scene, in short, which nature had too much good taste and calm
simplicity to realize. My mind had struggled to adapt these false
conceptions to the reality, and finding the effort vain, a wretched
sense of disappointment weighed me down. I climbed the precipice,
and threw myself on the earth, feeling that I was unworthy
to look at the Great Falls, and careless about beholding them
again.</p>

<p>All that night, as there has been and will be for ages past and
to come, a rushing sound was heard, as if a great tempest were
sweeping through the air. It mingled with my dreams, and made
them full of storm and whirlwind. Whenever I awoke, and heard
this dread sound in the air, and the windows rattling as with a
mighty blast, I could not rest again, till looking forth, I saw
how bright the stars were, and that every leaf in the garden was
motionless. Never was a summer night more calm to the eye, nor
a gale of autumn louder to the ear. The rushing sound proceeds
from the rapids, and the rattling of the casements is but an effect
of the vibration of the whole house, shaken by the jar of the
cataract. The noise of the rapids draws the attention from the
true voice of Niagara, which is a dull, muffled thunder, resounding
between the cliffs. I spent a wakeful hour at midnight, in distinguishing
its reverberations, and rejoiced to find that my former
awe and enthusiasm were reviving.</p>

<p>Gradually, and after much contemplation, I came to know, by
my own feelings, that Niagara is indeed a wonder of the world,
and not the less wonderful, because time and thought must be
employed in comprehending it. Casting aside all preconceived
notions, and preparation to be dire-struck or delighted, the beholder
must stand beside it in the simplicity of his heart, suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
the mighty scene to work its own impression. Night after
night I dreamed of it, and was gladdened every morning by the
consciousness of a growing capacity to enjoy it. Yet I will not
pretend to the all-absorbing enthusiasm of some more fortunate
spectators, nor deny that very trifling causes would draw my eyes
and thoughts from the cataract.</p>

<p>The last day that I was to spend at Niagara, before my departure
for the Far West, I sat upon the Table Rock. This celebrated
station did not now, as of old, project fifty feet beyond the
line of the precipice, but was shattered by the fall of an immense
fragment, which lay distant on the shore below. Still, on the
utmost verge of the rock, with my feet hanging over it, I felt as
if suspended in the open air. Never before had my mind been in
such perfect unison with the scene. There were intervals when I
was conscious of nothing but the great river, rolling calmly into
the abyss, rather descending than precipitating itself, and acquiring
tenfold majesty from its unhurried motion. It came like the
march of Destiny. It was not taken by surprise, but seemed to
have anticipated, in all its course through the broad lakes, that it
must pour their collected waters down this height. The perfect
foam of the river, after its descent, and the ever-varying shapes
of mist, rising up, to become clouds in the sky, would be the very
picture of confusion, were it merely transient, like the rage of a
tempest. But when the beholder has stood awhile, and perceives
no lull in the storm, and considers that the vapor and the foam
are as everlasting as the rocks which produce them, all this turmoil
assumes a sort of calmness. It soothes, while it awes the
mind.</p>

<p>Leaning over the cliff, I saw the guide conducting two adventurers
behind the falls. It was pleasant, from that high seat in
the sunshine, to observe them struggling against the eternal storm
of the lower regions, with heads bent down, now faltering, now
pressing forward, and finally swallowed up in their victory. After
their disappearance, a blast rushed out with an old hat, which it
had swept from one of their heads. The rock, to which they were
directing their unseen course, is marked, at a fearful distance on
the exterior of the sheet, by a jet of foam. The attempt to reach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
it appears both poetical and perilous to a looker-on, but may be
accomplished without much more difficulty or hazard than in
stemming a violent northeaster. In a few moments, forth came
the children of the mist. Dripping and breathless, they crept
along the base of the cliff, ascended to the guide’s cottage, and
received, I presume, a certificate of their achievement, with three
verses of sublime poetry on the back.</p>

<p>My contemplations were often interrupted by strangers who
came down from Forsyth’s to take their first view of the falls.
A short, ruddy, middle-aged gentleman, fresh from Old England,
peeped over the rock, and evinced his approbation by a broad
grin. His spouse, a very robust lady, afforded a sweet example of
maternal solicitude, being so intent on the safety of her little boy
that she did not even glance at Niagara. As for the child, he gave
himself wholly to the enjoyment of a stick of candy. Another
traveler, a native American, and no rare character among us, produced
a volume of Captain Hall’s tour, and labored earnestly to
adjust Niagara to the captain’s description, departing, at last,
without one new idea or sensation of his own. The next comer was
provided, not with a printed book, but with a blank sheet of foolscap,
from top to bottom of which, by means of an ever-pointed
pencil, the cataract was made to thunder. In a little talk which
we had together, he awarded his approbation to the general view,
but censured the position of Goat Island, observing that it should
have been thrown farther to the right, so as to widen the American
falls, and contract those of the Horseshoe. Next appeared two
traders of Michigan, who declared, that, upon the whole, the sight
was worth looking at; there certainly was an immense water-power
here; but that, after all, they would go twice as far to see
the noble stone-works of Lockport, where the Grand Canal is
locked down a descent of sixty feet. They were succeeded by a
young fellow, in a homespun cotton dress, with a staff in his hand,
and a pack over his shoulders. He advanced close to the edge of
the rock, where his attention, at first wavering among the different
components of the scene, finally became fixed in the angle of
the Horseshoe falls, which is indeed the central point of interest.
His whole soul seemed to go forth and be transported thither, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
the staff slipped from his relaxed grasp, and falling down—down—down—struck
upon the fragment of the Table Rock.</p>

<p>In this manner I spent some hours, watching the varied impression
made by the cataract on those who disturbed me, and
returning to unwearied contemplation, when left alone. At length
my time came to depart. There is a grassy footpath through the
woods, along the summit of the bank, to a point whence a cause-way,
hewn in the side of the precipice, goes winding down to the
Ferry, about half a mile below the Table Rock. The sun was near
setting, when I emerged from the shadow of the trees, and began
the descent. The indirectness of my downward road continually
changed the point of view, and showed me, in rich and repeated
succession, now, the whitening rapids and majestic leap of the
main river, which appeared more deeply massive as the light departed;
now, the lovelier picture, yet still sublime, of Goat Island,
with its rocks and grove, and the lesser falls, tumbling over the
right bank of the St. Lawrence, like a <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref853">tributary stream</a>; now, the
long vista of the river, as it <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref854">eddied and whirled</a> between the cliffs,
to pass through Ontario toward the sea, and everywhere to be wondered
at, for this one <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref855">unrivaled scene</a>. The golden sunshine tinged
the sheet of the American cascade, and painted on its heaving
spray the broken semi-circle of a rainbow, heaven’s own beauty
crowning earth’s sublimity. My steps were slow, and I paused
long at every turn of the descent, as one lingers and pauses who
discerns a brighter and <a href="#phrases72" title="List of phrases" id="ref856">brightening excellence</a> in what he must
soon behold no more. The solitude of the old wilderness now
reigned over the whole vicinity of the falls. My enjoyment became
the more rapturous, because no poet shared it, nor wretch
devoid of poetry profaned it; but the spot so famous through the
world was all my own!</p>

<h4>FROM MORN TILL NIGHT ON A FLORIDA RIVER</h4>

<p class="author">SIDNEY LANIER</p>

<p>For a perfect journey God gave us a perfect day. The little
Ocklawaha steamboat Marion had started on her voyage some
hours before daylight. She had taken on her passengers the night
previous. By seven o’clock on such a May morning as no words
could describe we had made twenty-five miles up the St. Johns.
At this point the Ocklawaha flows into the St. Johns, one hundred
miles above Jacksonville.</p>

<p>Presently we abandoned the broad highway of the St. Johns,
and turned off to the right into the narrow lane of the Ocklawaha.
This is the sweetest water-lane in the world, a lane which
runs for more than one hundred and fifty miles of pure delight
betwixt hedge-rows of oaks and cypresses and palms and magnolias
and mosses and vines; a lane clean to travel, for there is never
a speck of dust in it save the blue dust and gold dust which the
wind blows out of the flags and lilies.</p>

<p>As we advanced up the stream our wee craft seemed to emit her
steam in leisurely whiffs, as one puffs one’s cigar in a contemplative
walk through the forest. Dick, the pole-man, lay asleep on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
the guards, in great peril of rolling into the river over the three
inches between his length and the edge; the people of the boat
moved not, and spoke not; the white crane, the curlew, the heron,
the water-turkey, were scarcely disturbed in their <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref857">quiet avocations</a>
as we passed, and quickly succeeded in persuading themselves
after each momentary excitement of our gliding by, that
we were really no monster, but only some <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref858">day-dream of a monster</a>.</p>

<p>“Look at that snake in the water!” said a gentleman, as we sat
on deck with the engineer, just come up from his watch.</p>

<p>The engineer smiled. “Sir, it is a water-turkey,” he said,
gently.</p>

<p>The water-turkey is the most preposterous bird within the
range of ornithology. He is not a bird; he is a neck with such
<a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref859">subordinate rights</a>, members, belongings, and heirlooms as seem
necessary to that end. He has just enough stomach to arrange
nourishment for his neck, just enough wings to fly painfully along
with his neck, and just big enough legs to keep his neck from
dragging on the ground; and his neck is light-colored, while the
rest of him is black. When he saw us he jumped up on a limb
and stared. Then suddenly he dropped into the water, sank like
a leaden ball out of sight, and made us think he was drowned.
Presently the tip of his beak appeared, then the length of his neck
lay along the surface of the water. In this position, with his body
submerged, he shot out his neck, drew it back, wriggled it, twisted
it, twiddled it, and poked it spirally into the east, the west, the
north, and the south, round and round with a violence and energy
that made one think in the same breath of corkscrews and of lightnings.
But what nonsense! All that labor and <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref860">perilous contortion</a>
for a beggarly sprat or a couple of inches of water-snake.</p>

<p>Some twenty miles from the mouth of the Ocklawaha, at the
right-hand edge of the stream, is the handsomest residence in
America. It belongs to a certain alligator of my acquaintance,
a very honest and worthy <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref861">reptile of good repute</a>. A little cove of
water, dark-green under the overhanging leaves, placid and clear,
curves round at the river edge into the flags and lilies, with a curve
just heart-breaking for its pure beauty. This house of the alligator
is divided into apartments, little bays which are scalloped out by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
the lily-pads, according to the winding fancies of their growth.
My reptile, when he desires to sleep, has but to lie down anywhere;
he will find marvelous mosses for his mattress beneath him; his
sheets will be white lily-petals; and the green disks of the lily-pads
will straightway embroider themselves together above him
for his coverlet. He never quarrels with his cook, he is not the
slave of a kitchen, and his one house-maid—the stream—forever
sweeps his chambers clean. His conservatories there under the
glass of that water are ever, without labor, filled with the enchantments
of under-water growths.</p>

<p>His parks and his pleasure-grounds are larger than any king’s.
Upon my saurian’s house the winds have no power, the rains are
only a new delight to him, and the snows he will never see. Regarding
fire, as he does not use it as a slave, so he does not fear
it as a tyrant.</p>

<p>Thus all the elements are the friends of my alligator’s house.
While he sleeps he is being bathed. What glory to awake sweetened
and freshened by the sole, careless act of sleep!</p>

<p>Lastly, my saurian has unnumbered mansions, and can change
his dwelling as no human house-holder may; it is but a flip of his
tail, and lo! he is established in another place as good as the last,
ready furnished to his liking.</p>

<p>On and on up the river! We find it a river without banks.
The swift, deep current meanders between tall lines of trees;
beyond these, on either side, there is water also—a thousand shallow
rivulets lapsing past the bases of a multitude of trees.</p>

<p>Along the edges of the stream every tree-trunk, sapling, and
stump is wrapped about with a close-growing vine. The edges of
the stream are also defined by flowers and water-leaves. The tall
blue flags, the lilies sitting on their round lily-pads like white
queens on green thrones, the tiny stars and long ribbons of the water-grasses—all
these border the river in an <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref862">infinite variety</a> of
adornment.</p>

<p>And now, after this day of glory, came a night of glory.
Deep down in these shaded lanes it was dark indeed as the night
drew on. The stream which had been all day a <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref863">girdle of beauty</a>,
blue or green, now became a black <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref864">band of mystery</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>

<p>But presently a <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref865">brilliant flame flares</a> out overhead: They have
lighted the pine-knots on top of the pilot-house. The fire advances
up these dark windings like a brilliant god.</p>

<p>The startled birds suddenly flutter into the light and after an
instant of illuminated flight melt into the darkness. From the
perfect silence of these short flights one derives a certain <a href="#phrases73" title="List of phrases" id="ref866">sense
of awe</a>.</p>

<p>Now there is a mighty crack and crash: limbs and leaves
scrape and scrub along the deck; a little bell tinkles; we stop. In
turning a short curve, the boat has run her nose smack into the
right bank, and a projecting stump has thrust itself sheer through
the starboard side. Out, Dick! Out, Henry! Dick and Henry
shuffle forward to the bow, thrust forth their long white pole
against a tree-trunk, strain and push and bend to the deck as if
they were salaaming the god of night and adversity. Our bow
slowly rounds into the stream, the wheel turns and we puff quietly
along.</p>

<p>And now it is bed-time. Let me tell you how to sleep on an
Ocklawaha steamer in May. With a small bribe persuade Jim,
the steward, to take the mattress out of your berth and lay it
slanting just along the railing that encloses the lower part of the
deck in front and to the left of the pilot-house. Lie flat on your
back down on the mattress, draw your blanket over you, put your
cap on your head, on account of the night air, fold your arms,
say some little prayer or other, and fall asleep with a star looking
right down on your eye. When you wake in the morning you will
feel as new as Adam.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Sidney Lanier (1842-1881) was a native of Georgia. When
a mere lad, just out of college, he entered the Confederate army and faithfully
devoted the most precious years of his life to that service. While in
a military prison he contracted the dread “White Plague,” and during his
few remaining years he struggled constantly with disease and poverty. He
was a talented musician and often found it necessary to supplement the
earnings of his pen by playing in an orchestra. His thorough knowledge
and fine sense of music also appear in his masterly treatise on the “Science
of English Verse.” During his last years he held a lectureship on English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
Literature in Johns Hopkins University, at Baltimore. He has often been
compared with Poe in the exquisite melody of his verse, while in unaffected
simplicity and in truthfulness to nature he is not surpassed by Bryant or
Whittier. His prose as well as his poetry breathes the very spirit of his
sunny southland. In the “Song of the Chattahoochee”, “The Marshes of
Glynn,” and “On a Florida River,” one scents the balsam of the Georgia
pines among which he lived, and the odor of magnolia groves, jessamine,
and wild honey-suckle.</p>

<h5>THE VALLEY AND ITS SUPERSTITIONS</h5>

<p>In the bosom of one of those <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref867">spacious coves</a> which indent the
eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river
denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee,
and where they always prudently shortened sail, and implored the
protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small
market-town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh,
but which is more generally and properly known by the name of
Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days,
by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref868">inveterate
propensity</a> of their husbands to linger about the village
tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for
the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref869">precise and
authentic</a>. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles,
there is a little valley, or rather lap of land, among high hills,
which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small
brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to
repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail, or tapping of a
woodpecker, is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon
the uniform tranquillity.</p>

<p>I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting
was in a grove of tall walnut trees that shades one side
of the valley. I had wandered into it at noon time, when all nature
is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun,
as it broke the Sabbath stillness around, and was <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref870">prolonged and
reverberated</a> by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
retreat, whither I might steal from the world and its distractions,
and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know
of none more promising than this little valley.</p>

<p>From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character
of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch
settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name
of Sleepy Hollow, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow
Boys throughout all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy
influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very
atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a high
German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others,
that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held
his <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref871">pow-wows</a> there before the country was discovered by Master
Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under
the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds
of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie.
They are given to all kinds of marvelous beliefs; are subject to
trances and visions; and frequently see strange sights, and hear
music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds
with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars
shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other
part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole nine fold,
seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.</p>

<p>The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted
region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of
the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback without a head.
It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose
head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless
battle during the Revolutionary war; and who is ever and anon
seen by the country folk, hurrying along in the gloom of night, as
if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the
valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially
to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain
of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been
careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning
this specter, allege that the body of the trooper having been
buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
battle in nightly quest of his head; and that the rushing speed with
which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight
blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to
the churchyard before daybreak.</p>

<p>Such is the general purport of this <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref872">legendary superstition</a>,
which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region
of shadows; and the specter is known, at all the country firesides,
by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned
is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but
is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a
time. However wide awake they may have been before they
entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale
the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative—to
dream dreams, and see apparitions.</p>

<p>I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud; for it is in
such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed
in the great State of New York, that population, manners, and
customs remain fixed; while the <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref873">great torrent of migration</a> and
improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other
parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They
are like those little nooks of still water which border a rapid
stream; where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at
anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by
the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed
since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question
whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families
vegetating in its sheltered bosom.</p>

<h5>ICHABOD CRANE AND KATRINA VAN TASSEL</h5>

<p>In this by-place of nature, there abode, in a remote period of
American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy
wight of the name of Ichabod Crane; who sojourned, or, as he
expressed it, “tarried,” in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing
the children of the vicinity. He was a native of Connecticut,
a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the
mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
frontier woodsmen and country school-masters. The cognomen of
Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly
lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands
that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served
for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His
head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy
eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock,
perched upon his spindle neck, to tell which way the wind blew.
To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day,
with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have
mistaken him for the <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref874">genius of famine</a> descending upon the earth,
or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.</p>

<p>His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely
constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched
with leaves of old copy-books. It was most ingeniously secured
at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and
stakes set against the window shutters; so that, though a thief
might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment
in getting out; an idea most probably borrowed by the architect,
Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eel-pot. The schoolhouse
stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the
foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable
birch tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low
murmur of his pupils’ voices, conning over their lessons, might be
heard in a drowsy summer’s day, like the hum of a bee-hive;
interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master,
in the tone of menace or command; or, peradventure, by the appalling
sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along
the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was a conscientious
man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, “Spare the
rod and spoil the child.”—Ichabod Crane’s scholars certainly were
not spoiled.</p>

<p>I would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of
those <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref875">cruel potentates</a> of the school, who joy in the smart of their
subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimination
rather than severity, taking the burthen off the backs of
the weak and laying it on those of the strong. Your mere puny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed
by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by
inflicting a double portion on some little, tough, wrong-headed,
broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew
dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called “doing his
duty by their parents” and he never inflicted a chastisement without
following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting
urchin, that “he would remember it, and thank him for it the
longest day he had to live.”</p>

<p>When school hours were over, he was even the companion and
playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would
convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have
pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref876">comforts
of the cupboard</a>. Indeed it behooved him to keep on good
terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his school was
small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with
daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the
<a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref877">dilating powers of an anaconda</a>; but to help out his maintenance,
he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and
lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed.
With these he lived successively a week at a time; thus going the
rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up
in a cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his
rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a
grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various
ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted
the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms;
helped to make hay; mended the fences; took the horses to water;
drove the cows from pasture; and cut wood for the winter fire.
He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway
with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became
wonderfully gentle and ingratiating. He found favor in the eyes
of the mothers, by petting the children, particularly the youngest;
and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb
did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle
with his foot for whole hours together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master
of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by
instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no
little vanity to him, on Sundays, to take his station in front of
the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his
own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson.
Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the
congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in
that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite
to the opposite side of the mill-pond, on a still Sunday morning,
which are said to be <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref878">legitimately descended</a> from the nose of
Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts in that ingenious
way which is commonly denominated “by hook and by
crook,” the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was
thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork,
to have a wonderfully easy life of it.</p>

<p>The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in
the female circle of a rural neighborhood, being considered a kind
of idle gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments
to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior
in learning only to the parson. His appearance, therefore, is apt
to occasion some little stir at the tea table of a farmhouse, and
the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or,
peradventure, the parade of a silver teapot. Our man of letters,
therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country
damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard,
between services on Sundays! gathering grapes for them from the
wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their
amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with
a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent mill-pond;
while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back,
envying his superior elegance and address.</p>

<p>From his half itinerant life, also, he was a kind of traveling
gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to
house; so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction.
He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of
great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
was a perfect master of Cotton Mather’s history of New England
Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently
believed.</p>

<p>He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple
credulity. His appetite for the marvelous, and his powers of
digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased
by his residence in this spellbound region. No tale was
too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often
his delight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to
stretch himself on the rich bed of clover, bordering the little brook
that whimpered by his schoolhouse, and there con over old
Mather’s direful tales, until the gathering dusk of the evening
made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he
wended his way, by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to
the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound
of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination:
the moan of the whippoorwill from the hill-side; the boding cry
of the tree-toad, that harbinger of storm; the dreary hooting of the
screech-owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened
from their roost. The fire-flies, too, which sparkled most
vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one
of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by
chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering
flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost,
with the idea that he was struck with a witch’s token. His only
resource on such occasions, either to drown thought, or drive away
evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes; and the good people of
Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were
often filled with awe, at hearing his nasal melody, “in linked
sweetness long drawn out,” floating from the distant hill, or along
the dusky road.</p>

<p>Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long
winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by
the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the
hearth, and listen to their marvelous tales of ghosts and goblins,
and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and
haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him.
He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft,
and of the <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref879">direful omens</a> and portentous sights and sounds in the
air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and
would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and
shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did
absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!</p>

<p>But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in
the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow
from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no specter
dared to show his face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of
his subsequent walk homewards. What fearful shapes and
shadows beset his path amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a
snowy night!—With what wistful look did he eye every trembling
ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some
distant window!—How often was he appalled by some shrub
covered with snow, which, like a sheeted specter, beset his very
path!—How often did he shrink with <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref880">curdling awe</a> at the sound of
his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to
look over his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being
tramping close behind him!—and how often was he thrown into
complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees,
in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly
scourings!</p>

<p>All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms
of the mind that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many
specters in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in
divers shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an
end to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life of
it, in despite of the devil and all his works, if his path had not
been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal
man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together,
and that was—a woman.</p>

<p>Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in
each week, to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina
Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
farmer. She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a
partridge; ripe and melting and rosy cheeked as one of her
father’s peaches; and universally famed, not merely for her
beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a little of a
coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a
mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off
her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which
her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam;
the tempting stomacher of the olden time; and withal a provokingly
short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in
the country round.</p>

<p>Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart toward the sex;
and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon
found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her
in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect
picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He
seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the
boundaries of his own farm; but within those every thing was
snug, happy, and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his
wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty
abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold
was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those
green, sheltered, fertile nooks, in which the Dutch farmers are so
fond of nestling. A great elm-tree spread its broad branches over
it; at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and
sweetest water, in a little well, formed of a barrel; and then stole
sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that
bubbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the
farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church;
every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with
the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within
it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering
about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye
turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads
under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling,
and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the
sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
the repose and abundance of their pens, whence sallied forth, now
and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately
squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying
whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling
through the farmyard, and guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered
housewives, with their peevish discontented cry. Before
the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband,
a warrior, and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings,
and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart—sometimes
tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his
ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel
which he had discovered.</p>

<p>The pedagogue’s mouth watered, as he looked upon this <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref881">sumptuous
promise</a> of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind’s
eye he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with
a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons
were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a
coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy;
and the ducks pairing cozily in dishes, like snug married couples,
with a decent competency of onion sauce. In the porkers he saw
carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham;
not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard
under its wing, and peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages;
and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in
a side-dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which
his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.</p>

<p>As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled
his great green eyes over the fat meadow-lands, the rich fields of
wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards
burthened with ruddy fruit which surrounded the warm tenement
of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to
inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea,
how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested
in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the
wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and
presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of
children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld
himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting
out for Kentucky, Tennessee, or the Lord knows where.</p>

<p>When he entered the house the conquest of his heart was complete.
It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged,
but lowly-sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the
first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza
along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under
this were hung flails, harness, various <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref882">utensils of husbandry</a>, and
nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built
along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at
one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to
which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza
the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the center
of the mansion and the place of usual residence. Here rows of
resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes.
In one corner stood a huge bag of wool ready to be spun; in another
a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of
Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay
festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers;
and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where
the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like
mirrors; and irons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs,
glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and
conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various colored
birds’ eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung
from the center of the room; and a corner cupboard, knowingly
left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended
china.</p>

<p>From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of
delight the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study
was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van
Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties
than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who
seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and
such like easily-conquered adversaries, to contend with; and had
to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
walls of adamant, to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart
was confined, all which he achieved as easily as a man would
carve his way to the center of a Christmas pie; and then the lady
gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary,
had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset
with a <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref883">labyrinth of whims</a> and caprices, which were forever presenting
new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter
a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous
rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart; keeping a
watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in
the common cause against any new competitor.</p>

<h5>BROM BONES</h5>

<p>Among these the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering
blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch
abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round,
which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was
broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair,
and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air
of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great
powers of limb, he had received the nickname of <span class="smcap">Brom Bones</span>,
by which he was universally known. He was famed for great
knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback
as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock-fights;
and, with the ascendency which bodily strength acquires in rustic
life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side,
and giving his decisions with an air and tone admitting of no
gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a
frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition;
and, with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash
of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon
companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of
whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or
merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished
by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox’s tail; and when the
folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a
distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be
heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop
and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames,
startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the
hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, “Ay, there goes
Brom Bones and his gang!” The neighbors looked upon him with
a mixture of awe, admiration, and good will; and when any madcap
prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook
their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>This <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref884">rantipole hero</a> had for some time singled out the blooming
Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his
amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and
endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether
discourage his hopes. Certain it is, his advances were
signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to
cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen
tied to Van Tassel’s paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that
his master was courting, or, as it is termed, “sparking,” within, all
other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other
quarters.</p>

<p>Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had
to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he
would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would
have despaired. He had, however, a happy mixture of pliability
and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a
supple-jack—yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke;
and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the moment
it was away—jerk! he was as erect, and carried his head as
high as ever.</p>

<p>To have taken the field openly against his rival would have
been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours,
any more than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore,
made his advances in a quiet and gently-insinuating manner.
Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent
visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend
from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a
stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
easy, indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his
pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her
have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had
enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her
poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish
things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves.
Thus while the busy dame bustled about the house, or
plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt
would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the
achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword
in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle
of the barn. In the meantime, Ichabod would carry on his
suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great
elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to
the lover’s eloquence.</p>

<p>I profess not to know how women’s hearts are wooed and won.
To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration.
Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access;
while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a
thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain
the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain
possession of the latter, for the man must battle for his fortress at
every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts
is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed
sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is,
this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from
the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of
the former evidently declined; his horse was no longer seen tied
at the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually
arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<p>Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would
fain have carried matters to open warfare, and have settled their
pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise
and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore—by single
combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of
his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a
boast of Bones, that he would “double the schoolmaster up, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse”; and he was too wary
to give him an opportunity. There was something extremely provoking
in this <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref885">obstinately pacific system</a>; it left Brom no alternative
but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition,
and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival.
Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and
his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful
domains; smoked out his singing school, by stopping up the
chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its
formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned
everything topsy-turvy; so that the poor schoolmaster began to
think all the witches of the country held their meetings there.
But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities
of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had
a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous
manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod’s to instruct her in
psalmody.</p>

<h5>THE QUILTING FROLIC</h5>

<p>In this way matters went on for some time, without producing
any material effect on the relative situation of the contending
powers. On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood,
sat enthroned on the lofty stool whence he usually watched all
the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a
ferrule, that scepter of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed
on three nails, behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers;
while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband
articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of
idle urchins; such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs,
fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper game-cocks.
Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently
inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books,
or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the
master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the
schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of
a negro, in tow-cloth jacket and trousers, a round-crowned fragment
of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a
rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school door
with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or
“quilting frolic,” to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel’s;
and having delivered his message with that air of importance, and
effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty
embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen
scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry
of his mission.</p>

<p>All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom.
The scholars were hurried through their lessons, without stopping
at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity,
and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then
in the rear to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word.
Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves,
inkstands were over-turned, benches thrown down, and the whole
school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting
forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the
green, in joy of their <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref886">early emancipation</a>.</p>

<p>The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at
his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only,
suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken
looking-glass, that hung up in the schoolhouse. That he might
make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a
cavalier he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was
domiciled, a choleric old Dutchman, of the name of Hans Van
Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth, like a knight-errant,
in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in the true
spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and
equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was
a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything
but his viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck
and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled
and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil and was glaring
and spectral; but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it.
Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge
from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
favorite steed of his master’s, the choleric Van Ripper, who was
a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own
spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked,
there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly
in the country.</p>

<p>Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with
short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel
of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers; he
carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a scepter, and,
as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the
flapping of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top
of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called;
and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horse’s
tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed, as they
shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether
such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad
daylight.</p>

<p>It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day, the sky was clear
and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we
always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put
on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer
kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange,
purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of wild ducks began to make
their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be
heard from the groves of beech and hickory nuts, and the pensive
whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble-field.</p>

<p>The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the
fullness of their revelry they fluttered, chirping and frolicking,
from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion
and variety around them. There was the honest cock-robin,
the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud
querulous note, and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable
clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker, with his crimson crest,
his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar bird,
with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail, and its little montero
cap of feathers; and the blue-jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
gay light-blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering,
nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on
good terms with every songster of the grove.</p>

<p>As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to
every symptom of <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref887">culinary abundance</a>, ranged with delight over
the treasures of jolly autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store
of apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some
gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped
up in rich piles for the cider-press. Farther on he beheld great
fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their
leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty
pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning
up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects
of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant
buckwheat fields, breathing the odor of the bee-hive, and as he
beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slap-jacks,
well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the
delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.</p>

<p>Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and “sugared
suppositions,” he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills
which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty
Hudson. The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down into
the west. The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and
glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved
and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain. A few
amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move
them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually
into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the
mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the
precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater
depth to the dark-gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop
was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide,
her sail hanging uselessly against the mast, and as the reflection
of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel
was suspended in the air.</p>

<p>It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of
the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
and flower of the adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare, leathern-faced
race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings,
huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles. Their brisk withered
little dames, in close crimped caps, long waisted short-gowns,
homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico
pockets hanging on the outside. Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated
as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine
ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation.
The sons, in short square-skirted coats with rows of stupendous
brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the
fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin
for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country, as a
potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.</p>

<p>Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come
to the gathering on his favorite steed, Daredevil, a creature, like
himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself
could manage. He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious
animals, given to all kinds of tricks, which kept the rider in constant
risk of his neck, for he held a tractable well-broken horse as
unworthy of a lad of spirit.</p>

<p>Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that
burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state
parlor of Van Tassel’s mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom
lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the
ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous
time of autumn. Such heaped-up platters of cakes of various
and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced
Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the tenderer
oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes
and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole
family of cakes. And then there were apple pies and peach pies
and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and
moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and
pears, and quinces, not to mention broiled shad and roasted
chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled
higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with
the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
midst—Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss
this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with
my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry
as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.</p>

<p>He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in
proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer; and whose
spirits rose with eating as some men’s do with drink. He could
not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and
chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of
all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor. Then,
he thought, how soon he’d turn his back upon the old schoolhouse,
snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every
other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of
doors that should dare to call him comrade.</p>

<p>Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a
face dilated with content and good humor, round and jolly as the
harvest moon. His hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive,
being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder,
a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to fall to, and help themselves.</p>

<p>And now the sound of the music from the common room, or
hall, summoned to the dance. The musician was an old gray-headed
negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood
for more than half a century. His instrument was as old
and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped
on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the
bow with a motion of the head, bowing almost to the ground,
and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to
start.</p>

<p>Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his
vocal powers. Not a limb, not a fiber about him was idle; and to
have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering
about the room, you would have thought Saint Vitus himself,
that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person.
He was the admiration of all the negroes, who, having gathered,
of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood
forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eye-balls,
and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How
could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and
joyous? The lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and
smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom
Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by
himself in one corner.</p>

<p>When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a
knot of the sager folks, who, with old Van Tassel, sat smoking at
one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing
out long stories about the war.</p>

<p>This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was
one of those highly-favored places which abound with chronicle
and great men. The British and American line had run near it
during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding,
and infested with refugees, cowboys, and all kinds of border
chivalry. Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each story-teller
to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in
the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of
every exploit.</p>

<p>There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded
Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old
iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst
at the sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman who
shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned,
who, in the battle of Whiteplains, being an excellent master
of defense, parried a musket ball with a small sword, insomuch
that he absolutely felt it whiz around the blade, and glance off
at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show
the sword with the hilt a little bent. There were several more
that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was
persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to
a happy termination.</p>

<p>But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions
that succeeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary
treasures of the kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best
in these sheltered long-settled retreats, but are trampled under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of
our country places. Besides, there is no encouragement for
ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to
finish their first nap, and turn themselves in their graves, before
their surviving friends have traveled away from the neighborhood;
so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds
they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the
reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established
Dutch communities.</p>

<p>The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural
stories in these parts was doubtless owing to the vicinity
of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagion in the very air that
blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere
of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy
Hollow people were present at Van Tassel’s, and, as usual, were
doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales
were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings
heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major
André was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood. Some
mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the
dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter
nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The
chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite specter
of Sleepy Hollow, the headless horseman, who had been heard
several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said,
tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.</p>

<p>The <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref888">sequestered situation</a> of this church seems always to have
made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll,
surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its
decent whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian
purity beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope
descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees,
between which peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the
Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams
seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the
dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a
wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the
stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden
bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly
shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even
in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. This
was one of the favorite haunts of the headless horseman and the
place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was
told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he
met the horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow,
and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over
bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the
bridge, when the horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw
old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops
with a clap of thunder.</p>

<p>This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvelous
adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the galloping Hessian
as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that, on returning one
night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he had been overtaken
by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with
him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it, too, for Daredevil
beat the goblin horse all hollow, but, just as they came to
the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash
of fire.</p>

<p>All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men
talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and
then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep
in the mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind with large
extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added
many marvelous events that had taken place in his native State
of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly
walks about Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<p>The revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered
together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some
time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills.
Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite
swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter
of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
fainter until they gradually died away—and the late scene of
noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only lingered
behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have
a tête-a-tête with the heiress, fully convinced that he was now on
the high road to success. What passed at this interview I will
not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know. Something, however,
I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied
forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and
chop-fallen.—Oh, these women! these women! Could that girl
have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks?—Was her
encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure
her conquest of his rival?—Heaven only knows, not I!—Let it
suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had
been sacking a hen-roost rather than a fair lady’s heart. Without
looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth,
on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable,
and with several hearty cuffs and kicks, roused his steed most
uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was
soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and
whole valleys of timothy and clover.</p>

<h5>ICHABOD’S TERRIFYING EXPERIENCES</h5>

<p>It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted
and crestfallen, pursued his travel homewards, along the
sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which
he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as
dismal as himself. Far below him, the Tappan Zee spread its
dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall
mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the
dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking of the
watch dog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so
vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this
faithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn
crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far
off, from some farmhouse away among the hills—but it was like
a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him,
but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
guttural twang of a bull-frog, from a neighboring marsh, as if
sleeping uncomfortably, and turning suddenly in his bed.</p>

<p>All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the
afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection. The night
grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the
sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight. He
had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was, moreover, approaching
the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories
had been laid. In the center of the road stood an enormous tuliptree,
which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the
neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs were
gnarled, and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary
trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into
the air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate
André, who had been taken prisoner hard by, and was
universally known by the name of Major André’s tree. The
common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition,
partly out of sympathy for the fate of its <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref889">ill-starred</a> namesake,
and partly from the tales of strange sights and doleful
lamentations told concerning it.</p>

<p>As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle;
he thought his whistle was answered—it was but a blast sweeping
sharply through the dry branches. As he approached a little
nearer he thought he saw something white hanging in the midst of
the tree—he paused and ceased whistling; but on looking more
narrowly perceived that it was a place where the tree had been
scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he
heard a groan—his teeth chattered and his knees smote against
the saddle; it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another,
as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the
tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.</p>

<p>About two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed
the road and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known
by the name of Wiley’s swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by
side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the
road where the brook entered the wood a group of oaks and
chestnuts, matted thick with wild grapevines, threw a cavernous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was
at this identical spot that the unfortunate André was captured,
and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy
yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been
considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the
schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.</p>

<p>As he approached the stream his heart began to thump; he
summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a
score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across
the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old
animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the
fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the
reins on the other side and kicked lustily with the contrary foot;
it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to
plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles
and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and
heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward,
snuffing and snorting, but came to a stand just by the
bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling
over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side
of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark
shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something
huge, misshapen, black, and towering. It stirred not, but
seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready
to spring upon the traveler.</p>

<p>The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with
terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late;
and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin,
if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind?
Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in
stammering accents—“Who are you?” He received no reply. He
repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there
was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible
Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary
fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm
put itself in motion, and, with a scramble and a bound, stood at
once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree
be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions,
and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He
made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one
side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder,
who had now got over his fright and waywardness.</p>

<p>Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion,
and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones
with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed, in hopes of
leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse
to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up and fell into a walk, thinking
to lag behind—the other did the same. His heart began to
sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but
his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could
not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged
silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and
appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a
rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveler in
relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak,
Ichabod was horror struck, on perceiving that he was headless!—but
his horror was still more increased, on observing that the
head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried
before him on the pommel of the saddle; his terror rose to desperation;
he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder,
hoping, by a sudden movement, to give his companion the slip—but
the specter started full jump with him. Away then they
dashed through thick and thin; stones flying, and sparks flashing
at every bound. Ichabod’s flimsy garments fluttered in the air,
as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse’s head, in
the eagerness of his flight.</p>

<p>They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy
Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon,
instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged
headlong down hill to the left. This road leads through a sandy
hollow, shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it
crosses the bridge famous in goblin story, and just beyond swells
the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskillful rider an
apparent advantage in the chase; but just as he had got half way
through the hollow the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt
it slipping from under him. He seized it by the pommel, and
endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save
himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the
saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by
his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper’s
wrath passed across his mind—for it was his Sunday saddle; but
this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his
haunches; and (unskillful rider that he was!) he had much ado
to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes
on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse’s
back-bone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him
asunder.</p>

<p>An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that
the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a
silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not
mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under
the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones’s
ghostly competitor had disappeared. “If I can but reach that
bridge,” thought Ichabod, “I am safe.” Just then he heard the
black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied
that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs,
and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over
the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side; and now
Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish,
according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he
saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling
his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible
missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous
crash—he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder,
the black steed, and the goblin rider passed by like a
whirlwind.</p>

<p>The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle,
and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at
his master’s gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
breakfast—dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled
at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of
the brook, but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to
feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod and his saddle.
An inquiry was set on foot, and after <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref890">diligent investigation</a> they
came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the
church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of
horses’ hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious
speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a
broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black,
was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it
a shattered pumpkin.</p>

<p>The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster
was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper, as executor of his
estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly
effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for
the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy
small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes, full of
dogs’ ears; and a broken pitchpipe. As to the books and furniture
of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting
Cotton Mather’s History of Witchcraft, a New England Almanac,
and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a
sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless
attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van
Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were <a href="#phrases74" title="List of phrases" id="ref891">forthwith
consigned</a> to the flames by Hans Van Ripper, who from that
time forward determined to send his children no more to school,
observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading
and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and
he had received his quarter’s pay but a day or two before, he must
have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.</p>

<p>The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church
on the following Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected
in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where
the hat and pumpkin had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of
Bones, and a whole budget of others, were called to mind; and
when they had diligently considered them all, and compared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their
heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried
off by the galloping Hessian. As he was a bachelor, and in
nobody’s debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him.
The school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and
another pedagogue reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York,
on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the
ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence
that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighborhood,
partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and
partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the
heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the
country; had kept school and studied law at the same time, had
been admitted to the bar, turned politician, electioneered, written
for the newspapers, and finally had been made a justice of the Ten
Pound Court. Brom Bones, too, who shortly after his rival’s
disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the
altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the
story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty
laugh at the mention of the pumpkin, which led some to suspect
that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.</p>

<p>The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of
these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited
away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told
about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge
became more than ever an object of superstitious awe, and that
may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years,
so as to approach the church by the border of the mill-pond. The
schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay, and was reported
to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue; and
the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has
often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm
tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.</p>

<h4>THE GREAT STONE FACE</h4>

<p class="author">NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the sun was going down, a mother and her
little boy sat at the door of their cottage, talking about the Great
Stone Face. They had but to lift their eyes, and there it was
plainly to be seen, though miles away, with the sunshine brightening
all its features.</p>

<p>And what was the Great Stone Face?</p>

<p><a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref892">Embosomed amongst</a> a family of lofty mountains, there was a
valley so spacious that it contained many thousand inhabitants.
Some of these good people dwelt in log-huts, with the black forest
all around them, on the steep and difficult hillsides. Others had
their homes in comfortable farmhouses, and cultivated the rich
soil on the gentle slopes or level surfaces of the valley. Others,
again, were congregated into populous villages, where some wild,
highland rivulet, tumbling down from its birthplace in the upper
mountain region, had been caught and tamed by human cunning,
and compelled to turn the machinery of cotton-factories. The inhabitants
of this valley, in short, were numerous, and of many
modes of life. But all of them, grown people and children, had a
kind of familiarity with the Great Stone Face, although some possessed
the gift of distinguishing this grand natural phenomenon
more perfectly than many of their neighbors.</p>

<p>The Great Stone Face, then, was a work of Nature in her
mood of <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref893">majestic playfulness</a>, formed on the perpendicular side
of a mountain by some immense rocks, which had been thrown
together in such a position as, when viewed at a proper distance,
precisely to resemble the features of the human countenance. It
seemed as if an enormous giant, or a Titan, had sculptured his
own likeness on the precipice. There was the broad arch of the
forehead, a hundred feet in height; the nose, with its long bridge;
and the vast lips, which, if they could have spoken, would have
rolled their thunder accents from one end of the valley to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
other. True it is, that if the spectator approached too near, he
lost the outline of the gigantic visage, and could discern only a
heap of ponderous and gigantic rocks, piled in <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref894">chaotic ruin</a> one
upon another. Retracing his steps, however, the wondrous features
would again be seen; and the farther he withdrew from
them, the more like a human face, with all its <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref895">original divinity
intact</a>, did they appear; until, as it grew dim in the distance, with
the clouds and glorified vapor of the mountains clustering about
it, the Great Stone Face seemed positively to be alive.</p>

<p>It was a happy lot for children to grow up to manhood or
womanhood with the Great Stone Face before their eyes, for all
the features were noble, and the expression was at once grand
and sweet, as if it were the glow of a vast, warm heart, that embraced
all mankind in its affections, and had room for more. It
was an education only to look at it. According to the belief of
many people, the valley owed much of its fertility to this <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref896">benign
aspect</a> that was continually beaming over it, illuminating the
clouds, and infusing its tenderness into the sunshine.</p>

<p>As we began with saying, a mother and her little boy sat at
their cottage-door, gazing at the Great Stone Face, and talking
about it. The child’s name was Ernest.</p>

<p>“Mother,” said he, while the Titanic visage smiled on him,
“I wish that it could speak, for it looks so very kindly that its
voice must needs be pleasant. If I were to see a man with such a
face, I should love him dearly.”</p>

<p>“If an old prophecy should come to pass,” answered his
mother, “we may see a man, some time or other, with exactly such
a face as that.”</p>

<p>“What prophecy do you mean, dear mother?” eagerly inquired
Ernest. “Pray tell me all about it!”</p>

<p>So his mother told him a story that her own mother had told
to her, when she herself was younger than little Ernest; a story,
not of things that were past, but of what was yet to come; a
story, nevertheless, so very old, that even the Indians, who formerly
inhabited this valley, had heard it from their forefathers,
to whom, as they affirmed, it had been murmured by the mountain
streams, and whispered by the wind among the tree-tops.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
The purport was, that, at some future day, a child should be born
hereabouts, who was destined to become the greatest and noblest
personage of his time, and whose countenance, in manhood, should
bear an exact resemblance to the Great Stone Face. Not a few
old-fashioned people, and young ones likewise, in the ardor of
their hopes, still cherished an enduring faith in this old prophecy.
But others, who had seen more of the world, had watched and
waited till they were weary, and had beheld no man with such a
face, nor any man that proved to be much greater or nobler than
his neighbors, concluded it to be nothing but an idle tale. At all
events, the great man of the prophecy had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>“O mother, dear mother!” cried Ernest, clapping his hands
above his head, “I do hope that I shall live to see him!”</p>

<p>His mother was an affectionate and thoughtful woman, and
felt that it was wisest not to discourage the generous hopes of her
little boy. So she only said to him, “Perhaps you may.”</p>

<p>And Ernest never forgot the story that his mother told him.
It was always in his mind, whenever he looked upon the Great
Stone Face. He spent his childhood in the log-cottage where he
was born, and was dutiful to his mother, and helpful to her in
many things, assisting her much with his little hands, and more,
with his loving heart. In this manner, from a happy yet often
pensive child, he grew up to be a mild, quiet, unobtrusive boy,
and sun-browned with labor in the fields, but with more intelligence
brightening his aspect than is seen in many lads who have
been taught at famous schools. Yet Ernest had had no teacher,
save only that the Great Stone Face became one to him. When
the toil of the day was over, he would gaze at it for hours, until
he began to imagine that those vast features recognized him, and
gave him a smile of kindness and encouragement, responsive to
his own look of veneration. We must not take upon us to affirm
that this was a mistake, although the Face may have looked no
more kindly at Ernest than at all the world besides. But the
secret was that the boy’s tender and confiding simplicity discerned
what other people could not see; and thus the love, which was
meant for all, became his <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref897">peculiar portion</a>.</p>

<p>About this time there went a rumor throughout the valley, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
the great man, foretold from ages long ago, who was to bear a
resemblance to the Great Stone Face, had appeared at last. It
seems that, many years before, a young man had migrated from
the valley and settled at a distant seaport, where, after getting
together a little money, he had set up as a shopkeeper. His name—but
I could never learn whether it was his real one, or a nickname
that had grown out of his habits and success in life—was
Gathergold. Being shrewd and active, and endowed by Providence
with that inscrutable faculty which develops itself in what
the world calls luck, he became an exceedingly rich merchant,
and owner of a whole fleet of bulky-bottomed ships. All the
countries of the globe appeared to join hands for the mere purpose
of adding heap after heap to the <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref898">mountainous accumulation</a>
of this one man’s wealth. The cold regions of the north, almost
within the gloom and shadow of the Arctic Circle, sent him their
tribute in the shape of furs; hot Africa sifted for him the golden
sands of her rivers, and gathered up the ivory tusks of her great
elephants out of the forests; the East came bringing him the rich
shawls, and spices, and teas, and the effulgence of diamonds, and
the gleaming purity of large pearls. The ocean, not to be behind-hand
with the earth, yielded up her mighty whales, that Mr.
Gathergold might sell their oil, and make a profit on it. Be the
original commodity what it might, it was gold within his grasp. It
might be said of him, as of Midas in the fable, that whatever he
touched with his finger immediately glistened, and grew yellow,
and was changed at once into sterling metal, or, which suited him
still better, into piles of coin. And, when Mr. Gathergold had
become so very rich that it would have taken him a hundred years
only to count his wealth, he bethought himself of his native valley,
and resolved to go back thither, and end his days where he was
born. With this purpose in view, he sent a skillful architect to
build him such a palace as should be fit for a man of his vast
wealth to live in.</p>

<p>As I have said above, it had already been rumored in the
valley that Mr. Gathergold had turned out to be the prophetic
personage so long and vainly looked for, and that his visage was
the perfect and undeniable similitude of the Great Stone Face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
People were the more ready to believe that this must needs be
the fact, when they beheld the splendid edifice that rose, as if by
enchantment, on the site of his father’s old weatherbeaten farmhouse.
The exterior was of marble, so dazzlingly white that it
seemed as though the whole structure might melt away in the sunshine,
like those humbler ones which Mr. Gathergold, in his young
play-days, before his fingers were gifted with the <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref899">touch of transmutation</a>,
had been accustomed to build of snow. It had a richly
ornamented portico, supported by tall pillars, beneath which was
a lofty door, studded with silver knobs, and made of a kind of
variegated wood that had been brought from beyond the sea.
The windows, from the floor to the ceiling of each stately apartment,
were composed, respectively, of but one enormous pane of
glass, so transparently pure that it was said to be a finer medium
than even the vacant atmosphere. Hardly anybody had been
permitted to see the interior of this palace; but it was reported,
and with good semblance of truth, to be far more gorgeous than
the outside, insomuch that whatever was iron or brass in other
houses was silver or gold in this; and Mr. Gathergold’s bedchamber,
especially, made such a glittering appearance that no ordinary
man would have been able to close his eyes there. But, on the
other hand, Mr. Gathergold was now so inured to wealth, that
perhaps he could not have closed his eyes unless where the gleam
of it was certain to find its way beneath his eyelids.</p>

<p>In due time, the mansion was finished; next came the upholsterers,
with magnificent furniture; then, a whole troop of black
and white servants, the harbingers of Mr. Gathergold, who, in his
own majestic person, was expected to arrive at sunset. Our friend
Ernest, meanwhile, had been deeply stirred by the idea that the
great man, the noble man, the man of prophecy, after so many
ages of delay, was at length to be made manifest to his native
valley. He knew, boy as he was, that there were a thousand
ways in which Mr. Gathergold, with his vast wealth, might transform
himself into an angel of beneficence, and assume a control
over human affairs as wide and benignant as the smile of the
Great Stone Face. Full of faith and hope, Ernest doubted not
that what the people said was true, and that now he was to behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
the living likeness of those wondrous features on the mountain-side.
While the boy was still gazing up the valley, and fancying,
as he always did, that the Great Stone Face returned his gaze and
looked kindly at him, the rumbling of wheels was heard, approaching
swiftly along the winding road.</p>

<p>“Here he comes!” cried a group of people who were assembled
to witness the arrival. “Here comes the great Mr. Gathergold!”</p>

<p>A carriage, drawn by four horses, dashed round the turn of the
road. Within it, thrust partly out of the window, appeared the
physiognomy of the old man, with a skin as yellow as if his own
Midas-hand had transmuted it. He had a low forehead, small,
sharp eyes, puckered about with innumerable wrinkles, and very
thin lips, which he made still thinner by pressing them forcibly
together.</p>

<p>“The very image of the Great Stone Face!” shouted the people,
“Sure enough, the old prophecy is true; and here we have the
great man come, at last!”</p>

<p>And, what greatly perplexed Ernest, they seemed actually to
believe that here was the likeness which they spoke of. By the
roadside there chanced to be an old beggar-woman and two little
beggar-children, stragglers from some far-off region, who, as the
carriage rolled onward, held out their hands and lifted up their
doleful voices, most piteously beseeching charity. A yellow claw—the
very same that had clawed together so much wealth—poked
itself out of the coach-window, and dropped some copper coins
upon the ground; so that, though the great man’s name seems to
have been Gathergold, he might just as suitably have been nicknamed
Scattercopper. Still, nevertheless, with an earnest shout,
and with as much good faith as ever, the people bellowed—</p>

<p>“He is the very image of the Great Stone Face!”</p>

<p>But Ernest turned sadly from the wrinkled shrewdness of that
sordid visage, and gazed up the valley, where, amid a gathering
mist, gilded by the last sunbeams, he could still distinguish
those glorious features which had impressed themselves into his
soul. Their aspect cheered him. What did the benign lips seem
to say?</p>

<p>“He will come! Fear not, Ernest; the man will come!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span></p>

<p>The years went on, and Ernest ceased to be a boy. He had
grown to be a young man now. He attracted little notice from
the other inhabitants of the valley; for they saw nothing remarkable
in his way of life, save that, when the labor of the day was
over, he still loved to go apart and gaze and meditate upon the
Great Stone Face. According to their idea of the matter, it was a
folly, indeed, but pardonable, inasmuch as Ernest was industrious,
kind, and neighborly, and neglected no duty for the sake of indulging
this idle habit. They knew not that the Great Stone
Face had become a teacher to him, and that the sentiment which
was expressed in it would enlarge the young man’s heart, and fill
it with wider and deeper sympathies than other hearts. They
knew not that thence would come a better wisdom than could be
learned from books, and a better life than could be molded on the
defaced example of other human lives. Neither did Ernest know
that the thoughts and affections which came to him so naturally,
in the fields and at the fireside, and wherever he communed with
himself, were of a higher tone than those which all men shared
with him. A simple soul—simple as when his mother first taught
him the old prophecy—he beheld the marvelous features beaming
adown the valley, and still wondered that their human counterpart
was so long in making his appearance.</p>

<p>By this time poor Mr. Gathergold was dead and buried; and
the oddest part of the matter was that his wealth, which was
the body and spirit of his existence, had disappeared before his
death, leaving nothing of him but a living skeleton, covered over
with a wrinkled, yellow skin. Since the melting away of his gold,
it had been very generally conceded that there was no such striking
resemblance, after all, betwixt the ignoble features of the
ruined merchant and that majestic face upon the mountain-side.
So the people ceased to honor him during his lifetime, and quietly
consigned him to forgetfulness after his decease. Once in a while,
it is true, his memory was brought up in connection with the magnificent
palace which he had built, and which had long ago been
turned into a hotel for the accommodation of strangers, multitudes
of whom came, every summer, to visit that famous natural curiosity,
the Great Stone Face. Thus, Mr. Gathergold being discredited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
and thrown into the shade, the man of prophecy was
yet to come.</p>

<p>It so happened that a native-born son of the valley, many
years before, had enlisted as a soldier, and, after a great deal
of hard fighting, had now become an illustrious commander.
Whatever he may be called in history, he was known in camps
and on the battlefield under the nickname of Old Blood-and-Thunder.
This war-worn veteran, being now infirm with age and
wounds, and weary of the turmoil of a military life, and of the
roll of the drum and the clangor of the trumpet, that had so long;
been ringing in his ears, had lately signified a purpose of returning
to his native valley, hoping to find repose where he remembered
to have left it. The inhabitants, his old neighbors and their
grown-up children, were resolved to welcome the renowned warrior
with a salute of cannon and a public dinner; and all the more
enthusiastically, it being affirmed that now, at last, the likeness
of the Great Stone Face had actually appeared. An aid-de-camp
of Old Blood-and-Thunder, traveling through the valley, was said
to have been struck with the resemblance. Moreover the school-mates
and early acquaintances of the general were ready to testify,
on oath, that, to the best of their recollection, the aforesaid
general had been exceedingly like the majestic image, even when
a boy, only that the idea had never occurred to them at that
period. Great, therefore, was the excitement throughout the valley;
and many people, who had never once thought of glancing at
the Great Stone Face for years before, now spent their time in
gazing at it, for the sake of knowing exactly how General Blood-and-Thunder
looked.</p>

<p>On the day of the great festival, Ernest and all the other people
of the valley left their work, and proceeded to the spot where
the <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref900">sylvan banquet</a> was prepared. As he approached, the loud
voice of the Rev. Dr. Battleblast was heard, beseeching a blessing
on the good things set before them, and on the distinguished
friend of peace in whose honor they were assembled. The tables
were arranged in a cleared space of the woods, shut in by the surrounding
trees, except where a vista opened eastward, and afforded
a distant view of the Great Stone Face. Over the general’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
chair, which was a relic from the home of Washington, there was
an arch of verdant boughs, with the laurel profusely intermixed,
and surmounted by his country’s banner, beneath which he had
won his victories. Our friend Ernest raised himself on his tiptoes,
in hopes to get a glimpse of the celebrated guest; but there
was a mighty crowd about the tables anxious to hear the toasts
and speeches, and to catch any word that might fall from the
general in reply; and a volunteer company, doing duty as a guard,
pricked ruthlessly with their bayonets at any particularly quiet
person among the throng. So Ernest, being of an unobtrusive
character, was thrust quite into the background, where he could
see no more of Old Blood-and-Thunder’s physiognomy than if it
had been still blazing on the battlefield. To console himself, he
turned towards the Great Stone Face, which, like a faithful and
long-remembered friend, looked back and smiled upon him
through the vista of the forest. Meanwhile, however, he could
overhear the remarks of various individuals, who were comparing
the features of the hero with the face on the distant mountain-side.</p>

<p>“’Tis the same face, to a hair!” cried one man, cutting a caper
for joy.</p>

<p>“Wonderfully like, that’s a fact!” responded another.</p>

<p>“Like! why, I call it Old Blood-and-Thunder himself, in a
monstrous looking-glass!” cried a third. “And why not? He’s the
greatest man of this or any other age, beyond a doubt.”</p>

<p>And then all three of the speakers gave a great shout, which
communicated electricity to the crowd, and called forth a roar
from a thousand voices, that went reverberating for miles among
the mountains, until you might have supposed that the Great
Stone Face had poured its thunder-breath into the cry. All these
comments, and this vast enthusiasm, served the more to interest
our friend; nor did he think of questioning that now, at length,
the mountain-visage had found its human counterpart. It is true,
Ernest had imagined that this long-looked-for personage would
appear in the character of a man of peace, uttering wisdom, and
doing good, and making people happy. But, taking an habitual
breadth of view, with all his simplicity, he contended that Providence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
should choose its own method of blessing mankind, and
could conceive that this great end might be effected even by a
warrior and a bloody sword, should inscrutable wisdom see fit to
order matters so.</p>

<p>“The general! the general!” was now the cry. “Hush! silence!
Old Blood-and-Thunder’s going to make a speech.”</p>

<p>Even so; for, the cloth being removed, the general’s health
had been drunk, amid shouts of applause, and he now stood upon
his feet to thank the company. Ernest saw him. There he was,
over the shoulders of the crowd, from the two glittering epaulets
and embroidered collar upward, beneath the arch of green boughs
with intertwined laurel, and the banner drooping as if to shade
his brow! And there, too, visible in the same glance, through the
vista of the forest, appeared the Great Stone Face! And was
there, indeed, such a resemblance as the crowd had testified?
Alas, Ernest could not recognize it! He beheld a war-worn and
weatherbeaten countenance, full of energy, and expressive of an
iron will; but the gentle wisdom, the deep, broad, tender sympathies,
were altogether wanting in Old Blood-and-Thunder’s
visage; and even if the Great Stone Face had assumed his look
of stern command, the milder traits would still have tempered it.</p>

<p>“This is not the man of prophecy,” sighed Ernest to himself,
as he made his way out of the throng. “And must the world wait
longer yet?”</p>

<p>The mists had congregated about the distant mountain-side,
and there were seen the grand and awful features of the Great
Stone Face, awful but benignant, as if a mighty angel were sitting
among the hills, and enrobing himself in a cloud-vesture of gold
and purple. As he looked, Ernest could hardly believe but that a
smile beamed over the whole visage, with a radiance still brightening,
although without motion of the lips. It was probably the
effect of the western sunshine, melting through the thinly diffused
vapors that had swept between him and the object that he gazed
at. But—as it always did—the aspect of his marvelous friend
made Ernest as hopeful as if he had never hoped in vain.</p>

<p>“Fear not, Ernest,” said his heart, even as if the Great Face
were whispering him—“fear not, Ernest; he will come.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span></p>

<p>More years sped swiftly and tranquilly away. Ernest still
dwelt in his native valley, and was now a man of middle age. By
imperceptible degrees, he had become known among the people.
Now, as heretofore, he labored for his bread, and was the same
simple-hearted man that he had always been. But he had thought
and felt so much, he had given so many of the best hours of his
life to unworldly hopes for some great good to mankind, that it
seemed as though he had been talking with the angels, and had
imbibed a portion of their wisdom unawares. It was visible in the
calm and well-considered beneficence of his daily life, the quiet
stream of which had made a wide green margin all along its
course. Not a day passed by, that the world was not the better
because this man, humble as he was, had lived. He never stepped
aside from his own path, yet would always reach a blessing to his
neighbor. Almost involuntarily, too, he had become a preacher.
The pure and high simplicity of his thought, which, as one of its
manifestations, took shape in the good deeds that dropped silently
from his hand, flowed also forth in speech. He uttered truths
that wrought upon and molded the lives of those who heard him.
His auditors, it may be, never suspected that Ernest, their own
neighbor and familiar friend, was more than an ordinary man;
least of all did Ernest himself suspect it; but, inevitably as the
murmur of a rivulet, came thoughts out of his mouth that no other
human lips had spoken.</p>

<p>When the people’s minds had had a little time to cool, they
were ready enough to acknowledge their mistake in imagining a
similarity between General Blood-and-Thunder’s truculent physiognomy
and the benign visage on the mountain-side. But now,
again, there were reports and many paragraphs in the newspapers,
affirming that the likeness of the Great Stone Face had appeared
upon the broad shoulders of a certain eminent statesman. He,
like Mr. Gathergold and Old Blood-and-Thunder, was a native
of the valley, but had left it in his early days, and taken up the
trades of law and politics. Instead of the rich man’s wealth and
the warrior’s sword, he had but a tongue, and it was mightier than
both together. So wonderfully eloquent was he, that whatever
he might choose to say, his auditors had no choice but to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
him; wrong looked like right, and right like wrong; for when it
pleased him, he could make a kind of illuminated fog with his
mere breath, and obscure the natural daylight with it. His tongue,
indeed, was a magic instrument: sometimes it rumbled like the
thunder; sometimes it warbled like the sweetest music. It was
the blast of war—the song of peace; and it seemed to have a heart
in it, when there was no such matter. In good truth, he was a
wondrous man; and when his tongue had acquired him all other
imaginable success—when it had been heard in halls of state, and
in the courts of princes and potentates—after it had made him
known all over the world, even as a voice crying from shore to
shore—it finally persuaded his countrymen to select him for the
Presidency. Before this time—indeed, as soon as he began to
grow celebrated—his admirers had found out the resemblance
between him and the Great Stone Face; and so much were they
struck by it, that throughout the country this distinguished gentleman
was known by the name of Old Stony Phiz. The phrase
was considered as giving a highly favorable aspect to his political
prospects; for, as is likewise the case with the Popedom, nobody
ever becomes President without taking a name other than his own.</p>

<p>While his friends were doing their best to make him President,
Old Stony Phiz, as he was called, set out on a visit to the valley
where he was born. Of course, he had no other object than to
shake hands with his fellow-citizens, and neither thought nor
cared about any effect which his progress through the country
might have upon the election. Magnificent preparations were
made to receive the illustrious statesman; a cavalcade of horsemen
set forth to meet him at the boundary line of the State, and
all the people left their business and gathered along the wayside
so to see him pass. Among these was Ernest. Though more than
once disappointed, as we have seen, he had such a hopeful and
confiding nature that he was always ready to believe in whatever
seemed beautiful and good. He kept his heart continually open,
and thus was sure to catch the blessing from on high when it
should come. So now again, as buoyantly as ever, he went forth
to behold the likeness of the Great Stone Face.</p>

<p>The cavalcade came prancing along the road, with a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
clattering of hoofs and a mighty cloud of dust, which rose up so
dense and high that the visage of the mountain-side was completely
hidden from Ernest’s eyes. All the great men of the neighborhood
were there on horseback; militia officers, in uniform; the
member of Congress; the sheriff of the county; the editors of newspapers;
and many a farmer, too, had mounted his patient steed,
with his Sunday coat upon his back. It really was a very brilliant
spectacle, especially as there were numerous banners flaunting
over the cavalcade, on some of which were gorgeous portraits of
the illustrious statesman and the Great Stone Face, smiling familiarly
at one another, like two brothers. If the pictures were to be
trusted, the mutual resemblance, it must be confessed, was marvelous.
We must not forget to mention that there was a band of
music, which made the echoes of the mountains ring and reverberate
with the loud triumph of its strains; so that airy and soul-thrilling
melodies broke out among all the heights and hollows,
as if every nook of his native valley had found a voice, to welcome
the distinguished guest. But the grandest effect was when
the far-off mountain precipice flung back the music; for then
the Great Stone Face itself seemed to be swelling the triumphant
chorus, in acknowledgment that, at length, the man of prophecy
was come.</p>

<p>All this while the people were throwing up their hats and
shouting with enthusiasm so contagious that the heart of Ernest
kindled up, and he likewise threw up his hat, and shouted, as
loudly as the loudest, “Huzza for the great man! Huzza for Old
Stony Phiz!” But as yet he had not seen him.</p>

<p>“Here he is, now!” cried those who stood near Ernest. “There!
There! Look at Old Stony Phiz and then at the Old Man of the
Mountain, and see if they are not as like as two twin-brothers!”</p>

<p>In the midst of all this gallant array came an open barouche,
drawn by four white horses; and in the barouche, with his massive
head uncovered, sat the illustrious statesman, Old Stony Phiz
himself.</p>

<p>“Confess it,” said one of Ernest’s neighbors to him, “the Great
Stone Face has met its match at last!”</p>

<p>Now, it must be owned that, at his first glimpse of the countenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
which was bowing and smiling from the barouche, Ernest
did fancy that there was a resemblance between it and the old
familiar face upon the mountain-side. The brow, with its massive
depth and loftiness, and all the other features, indeed, were boldly
and strongly hewn, as if in emulation of a more than heroic, of a
Titanic model. But the sublimity and stateliness, the grand expression
of a divine sympathy, that illuminated the mountain
visage and etherealized its ponderous granite substance into spirit,
might here be sought in vain. Something had been originally left
out, or had departed. And therefore the marvelously gifted statesman
had always a weary gloom in the deep caverns of his eyes, as
of a child that has outgrown its playthings or a man of mighty
faculties and little aims, whose life, with all its high performances,
was vague and empty, because no high purpose had endowed it
with reality.</p>

<p>Still, Ernest’s neighbor was thrusting his elbow into his side,
and pressing him for an answer.</p>

<p>“Confess! confess! Is not he the very picture of your Old Man
of the Mountain?”</p>

<p>“No!” said Ernest, bluntly, “I see little or no likeness.”</p>

<p>“Then so much the worse for the Great Stone Face!” answered
his neighbor; and again he set up a shout for Old Stony Phiz.</p>

<p>But Ernest turned away, melancholy, and almost despondent;
for this was the saddest of his disappointments, to behold a man
who might have fulfilled the prophecy, and had not willed to do
so. Meantime, the cavalcade, the banners, the music, and the
barouches swept past him, with the vociferous crowd in the rear,
leaving the dust to settle down, and the Great Stone Face to be
revealed again, with the grandeur that it had worn for untold
centuries.</p>

<p>“Lo, here I am, Ernest!” the benign lips seemed to say. “I
have waited longer than thou, and am not yet weary. Fear not;
the man will come.”</p>

<p>The years hurried onward, treading in their haste on one another’s
heels. And now they began to bring white hairs, and scatter
them over the head of Ernest; they made reverend wrinkles
across his forehead, and furrows in his cheeks. He was an aged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
man. But not in vain had he grown old: more than the white
hairs on his head were the sage thoughts in his mind; his wrinkles
and furrows were inscriptions that Time had graved, and in which
he had written legends of wisdom that had been tested by the
tenor of a life. And Ernest had ceased to be obscure. Unsought
for, undesired, had come the fame which so many seek, and made
him known in the great world, beyond the limits of the valley in
which he had dwelt so quietly. College professors, and even the
active men of cities, came from far to see and converse with
Ernest; for the report had gone abroad that this simple husbandman
had ideas unlike those of other men, not gained from books,
but of a higher tone—a tranquil and familiar majesty, as if he had
been talking with the angels as his daily friends. Whether it
were sage, statesman, or philanthropist, Ernest received these visitors
with the gentle sincerity that had characterized him from
boyhood, and spoke freely with them of whatever came uppermost,
or lay deepest in his heart or their own. While they talked
together, his face would kindle, unawares, and shine upon them,
as with a mild evening light. Pensive with the fulness of such
discourse, his guests took leave and went their way; and passing
up the valley, paused to look at the Great Stone Face, imagining
that they had seen its likeness in a human countenance, but could
not remember where.</p>

<p>While Ernest had been growing up and growing old, a bountiful
Providence had granted a new poet to this earth. He, likewise,
was a native of the valley, but had spent the greater part of his
life at a distance from that romantic region, pouring out his sweet
music amid the bustle and din of cities. Often, however, did the
mountains which had been familiar to him in his childhood lift
their snowy peaks into the clear atmosphere of his poetry. Neither
was the Great Stone Face forgotten, for the poet had celebrated
it in an ode, which was grand enough to have been uttered by its
own majestic lips. This man of genius, we may say, had come
down from heaven with wonderful endowments. If he sang of a
mountain, the eyes of all mankind beheld a mightier grandeur
reposing on its breast, or soaring to its summit, than had before
been seen there. If his theme were a lovely lake, a celestial smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
had now been thrown over it, to gleam forever on its surface. If
it were the vast old sea, even the deep immensity of its dread
bosom seemed to swell the higher, as if moved by the emotions
of the song. Thus the world assumed another and a better aspect
from the hour that the poet blessed it with his happy eyes. The
Creator had bestowed him, as the last best touch to his own handiwork.
Creation was not finished till the poet came to interpret,
and so complete it.</p>

<p>The effect was no less high and beautiful, when his human
brethren were the subject of his verse. The man or woman, sordid
with the common dust of life, who crossed his daily path, and the
little child who played in it, were glorified if he beheld them in his
mood of poetic faith. He showed the golden links of the great
chain that intertwined them with an <a href="#phrases75" title="List of phrases" id="ref901">angelic kindred</a>; he brought
out the hidden traits of a celestial birth that made them worthy
of such kin. Some, indeed, there were, who thought to show the
soundness of their judgment by affirming that all the beauty and
dignity of the natural world existed only in the poet’s fancy. Let
such men speak for themselves, who undoubtedly appear to have
been spawned forth by Nature with a contemptuous bitterness;
she having plastered them up out of her refuse stuff, after all the
swine were made. As respects all things else, the poet’s ideal was
the truest truth.</p>

<p>The songs of this poet found their way to Ernest. He read
them after his customary toil, seated on the bench before his cottage-door,
where for such a length of time he had filled his repose
with thought, by gazing at the Great Stone Face. And now as he
read stanzas that caused the soul to thrill within him, he lifted his
eyes to the vast countenance beaming on him so benignantly.</p>

<p>“O majestic friend,” he murmured, addressing the Great Stone
Face, “is not this man worthy to resemble thee?”</p>

<p>The Face seemed to smile, but answered not a word.</p>

<p>Now it happened that the poet, though he dwelt so far away,
had not only heard of Ernest, but had meditated much upon his
character, until he deemed nothing so desirable as to meet this
man, whose untaught wisdom walked hand in hand with the noble
simplicity of his life. One summer morning, therefore, he took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
passage by the railroad, and, in the decline of the afternoon,
alighted from the cars at no great distance from Ernest’s cottage.
The great hotel, which had formerly been the palace of Mr.
Gathergold, was close at hand, but the poet, with his carpetbag
on his arm, inquired at once where Ernest dwelt, and was resolved
to be accepted as his guest.</p>

<p>Approaching the door, he there found the good old man, holding
a volume in his hand, which alternately he read, and then,
with a finger between the leaves, looked lovingly at the Great
Stone Face.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said the poet. “Can you give a traveler a
night’s lodging?”</p>

<p>“Willingly,” answered Ernest; and then he added, smiling,
“Methinks I never saw the Great Stone Face look so hospitably
at a stranger.”</p>

<p>The poet sat down on the bench beside him, and he and Ernest
talked together. Often had the poet held intercourse with the
wittiest and the wisest but never before with a man like Ernest,
whose thoughts and feelings gushed up with such a natural freedom,
and who made great truths so familiar by his simple utterance
of them. Angels, as had been so often said, seemed to have
wrought with him at his labor in the fields; angels seemed to have
sat with him by the fireside; and, dwelling with angels as friend
with friends, he had imbibed the sublimity of their ideas, and
imbued it with the sweet and lowly charm of household words. So
thought the poet. And Ernest, on the other hand, was moved
and agitated by the living images which the poet flung out of his
mind, and which peopled all the air about the cottage-door with
shapes of beauty, both gay and pensive. The sympathies of these
two men instructed them with a profounder sense than either could
have attained alone. Their minds accorded into one strain, and
made delightful music which neither of them could have claimed
as all his own, nor distinguished his own share from the other’s.
They led one another, as it were, into a high pavilion of their
thoughts, so remote, and hitherto so dim, that they had never
entered it before, and so beautiful that they desired to be there
always.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>

<p>As Ernest listened to the poet, he imagined that the Great
Stone Face was bending forward to listen too. He gazed earnestly
into the poet’s glowing eyes.</p>

<p>“Who are you, my strangely gifted guest?” he said.</p>

<p>The poet laid his finger on the volume that Ernest had been
reading.</p>

<p>“You have read these poems,” said he. “You know me, then,
for I wrote them.”</p>

<p>Again, and still more earnestly than before, Ernest examined
the poet’s features; then turned towards the Great Stone Face;
then back, with an uncertain aspect, to his guest. But his countenance
fell; he shook his head, and sighed.</p>

<p>“Wherefore are you sad?” inquired the poet.</p>

<p>“Because,” replied Ernest, “all through life I have awaited
the fulfilment of a prophecy; and, when I read these poems, I
hoped that it might be fulfilled in you.”</p>

<p>“You hoped,” answered the poet, faintly smiling, “to find in
me the likeness of the Great Stone Face. And you are disappointed,
as formerly with Mr. Gathergold, and Old Blood-and-Thunder,
and Old Stony Phiz. Yes, Ernest, it is my doom. You
must add my name to the illustrious three, and record another
failure of your hopes. For—in shame and sadness do I speak it,
Ernest—I am not worthy to be typified by yonder benign and
majestic image.”</p>

<p>“And why?” asked Ernest. He pointed to the volume. “Are
not those thoughts divine?”</p>

<p>“They have a strain of the Divinity,” replied the poet. “You
can hear in them the far-off echo of a heavenly song. But my life,
dear Ernest, has not corresponded with my thought. I have had
grand dreams, but they have been only dreams, because I have
lived—and that, too, by my own choice—among poor and mean
realities. Sometimes even—shall I dare to say it?—I lack faith
in the grandeur, the beauty, and the goodness, which my own
works are said to have made more evident in nature and in human
life. Why, then, pure seeker of the good and true, shouldst thou
hope to find me, in yonder image of the divine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span></p>

<p>The poet spoke sadly, and his eyes were dim with tears. So,
likewise, were those of Ernest.</p>

<p>At the hour of sunset, as had long been his frequent custom,
Ernest was to discourse to an assemblage of the neighboring inhabitants
in the open air. He and the poet, arm in arm, still
talking together as they went along, proceeded to the spot. It
was a small nook among the hills, with a gray precipice behind,
the stern front of which was relieved by the pleasant foliage of
many creeping plants that made a tapestry for the naked rock, by
hanging their festoons from all its rugged angles. At a small elevation
above the ground, set in a rich framework of verdure, there
appeared a niche, spacious enough to admit a human figure, with
freedom for such gestures as spontaneously accompany earnest
thought and genuine emotion. Into this natural pulpit Ernest
ascended, and threw a look of familiar kindness around upon his
audience. They stood, or sat, or reclined upon the grass, as
seemed good to each, with the departing sunshine falling obliquely
over them, and mingling its subdued cheerfulness with the solemnity
of a grove of ancient trees, beneath and amid the boughs
of which the golden rays were constrained to pass. In another
direction was seen the Great Stone Face, with the same cheer,
combined with the same solemnity, in its benignant aspect.</p>

<p>Ernest began to speak, giving to the people of what was in his
heart and mind. His words had power, because they accorded
with his thoughts; and his thoughts had reality and depth, because
they harmonized with the life which he had always lived.
It was not mere breath that this preacher uttered; they were the
words of life, because a life of good deeds and holy love was melted
into them. Pearls, pure and rich, had been dissolved into this precious
draught. The poet, as he listened, felt that the being and
character of Ernest were a nobler strain of poetry than he had
ever written. His eyes glistening with tears, he gazed reverentially
at the venerable man, and said within himself that never
was there an aspect so worthy of a prophet and a sage as that
mild, sweet, thoughtful countenance, with the glory of white hair
diffused about it. At a distance, but distinctly to be seen, high up
in the golden light of the setting sun, appeared the Great Stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
Face, with hoary mists around it, like the white hairs around the
brow of Ernest. Its look of grand beneficence seemed to embrace
the world.</p>

<p>At that moment, in sympathy with a thought which he was
about to utter, the face of Ernest assumed a grandeur of expression,
so imbued with benevolence, that the poet, by an irresistible
impulse, threw his arms aloft, and shouted—</p>

<p>“Behold! Behold! Ernest is himself the likeness of the Great
Stone Face!”</p>

<p>Then all the people looked, and saw that what the deep-sighted
poet said was true. The prophecy was fulfilled. But Ernest,
having finished what he had to say, took the poet’s arm, and
walked slowly homeward, still hoping that some wiser and better
man than himself would by and by appear, bearing a resemblance
to the Great Stone Face.</p>

<h4>THE CELEBRATED JUMPING FROG</h4>

<p class="author">MARK TWAIN</p>

<p><a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref902">In compliance</a> with the request of a friend of mine, who wrote
me from the East, I called on good-natured, garrulous old Simon
Wheeler, and inquired after my friend’s friend, <em>Leonidas W.</em>
Smiley, as requested to do, and I <a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref903">hereunto append</a> the result. I
have a lurking suspicion that <em>Leonidas W.</em> Smiley is a myth; that
my friend never knew such a personage; and that he only conjectured
that, if I asked old Wheeler about him, it would remind him
of his infamous <em>Jim</em> Smiley, and he would go to work and bore me
nearly to death with some infernal reminiscence of him as long
and tedious as it should be useless to me. If that was the design,
it certainly succeeded.</p>

<p>I found Simon Wheeler dozing comfortably by the bar-room
stove of the old, dilapidated tavern in the ancient mining camp
of Angel’s, and I noticed that he was fat and bald-headed, and
had an expression of winning gentleness and simplicity upon his
tranquil countenance. He roused up and gave me good-day. I
told him a friend of mine had commissioned me to make some
inquiries about a cherished companion of his boyhood named
<em>Leonidas W.</em> Smiley—<em>Rev. Leonidas W.</em> Smiley—a young minister
of the Gospel, who he had heard was at one time a resident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
of Angel’s Camp. I added that, if Mr. Wheeler could tell me
anything about this Rev. Leonidas W. Smiley, I would feel under
many obligations to him.</p>

<p>Simon Wheeler backed me into a corner and blockaded me
there with his chair, and then sat me down and reeled off the
monotonous narrative which follows this paragraph. He never
smiled, he never frowned, he never changed his voice from the
gentle-flowing key to which he tuned the <a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref904">initial sentence</a>, he never
betrayed the <a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref905">slightest suspicion of enthusiasm</a>; but all through
the interminable narrative there ran a vein of impressive earnestness
and sincerity, which showed me plainly that, so far from
his imagining that there was anything ridiculous or funny about
his story, he regarded it as a really important matter, and admired
its two heroes as men of <a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref906">transcendent genius in <i lang="fr">finesse</i></a>.
To me, the spectacle of a man drifting serenely along through
such a queer yarn without ever smiling, was exquisitely absurd.
As I said before, I asked him to tell me what he knew of Rev.
Leonidas W. Smiley, and he replied as follows. I let him go on
in his own way, and never interrupted him once:</p>

<p>There was a feller here once by the name of <em>Jim</em> Smiley, in
the winter of ’49—or maybe it was the spring of ’50—I don’t recollect
exactly, somehow, though what makes me think it was one
or the other is because I remember the big flume wasn’t finished
when he first came to the camp; but any way, he was the curiosest
man about always betting on any thing that turned up you ever
see, if he could get anybody to bet on the other side; and if he
couldn’t, he’d change sides. Any way that suited the other man
would suit him—any way just so’s he got a bet, <em>he</em> was satisfied.
But still he was lucky, uncommon lucky; he most always come
out winner. He was always ready and laying for a chance; there
couldn’t be no solit’ry thing mentioned but that feller’d offer to
bet on it, and take any side you please, as I was just telling you.
If there was a horse-race, you’d find him flush or you’d find him
busted at the end of it; if there was a dog-fight, he’d bet on it; if
there was a cat-fight, he’d bet on it; if there was a chicken-fight,
he’d bet on it; why, if there was two birds setting on a fence, he
would bet you which one would fly first; or if there was a camp-meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
he would be there reg’lar, to bet on Parson Walker,
which he judged to be the best exhorter about here, and so he
was, too, and a good man. If he even seen a straddle-bug start to
go anywheres, he would bet you how long it would take him to
get to wherever he was going to, and if you took him up, he
would foller that straddle-bug to Mexico but what he would find
out where he was bound for and how long he was on the road.
Lots of the boys here has seen that Smiley, and can tell you about
him. Why, it never made no difference to <em>him</em>—he would bet on
<em>any</em> thing—the dangdest feller. Parson Walker’s wife laid very
sick once, for a good while, and it seemed as if they warn’t going
to save her; but one morning he come in, and Smiley asked how
she was, and he said she was considerable better—thank the Lord
for his inf’nit mercy—and coming on so smart that, with the
blessing of Prov’dence, she’d get well yet; and Smiley, before he
thought, says, “Well, I’ll risk two-and-a-half that she don’t, any
way.”</p>

<p>Thish-yer Smiley had a mare—the boys called her the fifteen-minute
nag, but that was only in fun, you know, because, of
course, she was faster than that—and he used to win money on
that horse, for all she was so slow and always had the asthma, or
the distemper, or the consumption, or something of that kind.
They used to give her two or three hundred yards start, and then
pass her under way; but always at the fag-end of the race she’d
get excited and desperate-like, and come <a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref907">cavorting and straddling
up</a>, and scattering her legs around limber, sometimes in the
air, and sometimes out to one side amongst the fences, and kicking
up m-o-r-e dust, and raising m-o-r-e racket with her coughing
and sneezing and blowing her nose—and always fetch up at the
stand just about a neck ahead, as near as you could cipher it down.</p>

<p>And he had a little small bull pup, that to look at him you’d
think he wan’t worth a cent, but to set around and look ornery,
and lay for a chance to steal something. But as soon as money
was up on him, he was a different dog; his underjaw’d begin to
stick out like the fo’castle of a steamboat, and his teeth would
uncover, and shine savage like the furnaces. And a dog might
tackle him, and bully-rag him, and bite him, and throw him over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
his shoulder two or three times, and Andrew Jackson—which was
the name of the pup—Andrew Jackson would never let on but
what <em>he</em> was satisfied, and hadn’t expected nothing else—and the
bets being doubled and doubled on the other side all the time, till
the money was all up; and then all of a sudden he would grab
that other dog jest by the j’int of his hind leg and freeze to it—not
chaw, you understand, but only jest grip and hang on till
they throwed up the sponge, if it was a year. Smiley always
come out winner on that pup, till he harnessed a dog once that
didn’t have no hind legs, because they’d been sawed off by a circular
saw, and when the thing had gone along far enough, and
the money was all up, and he come to make a snatch for his pet
holt, he saw in a minute how he’d been imposed on, and how the
other dog had been in the door, so to speak, and he ’peared surprised,
and then he looked sorter discouraged-like, and didn’t
try no more to win the fight, and so he got shucked out bad. He
give Smiley a look, as much as to say his heart was broke, and it
was <em>his</em> fault, for putting up a dog that hadn’t no hind legs for
him to take holt of, which was his main dependence in a fight, and
then he limped off a piece and laid down and died. It was a good
pup, was that Andrew Jackson, and would have made a name for
hisself if he’d lived, for the stuff was in him, and he had genius—I
know it, because he hadn’t had no opportunities to speak of,
and it don’t stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight
as he could under them circumstances, if he hadn’t no talent. It
always makes me feel sorry when I think of that last fight of
his’n, and the way it turned out.</p>

<p>Well, thish-yer Smiley had rat-tarriers, and chicken cocks,
and tom-cats, and all them kind of things, till you couldn’t rest,
and you couldn’t fetch nothing for him to bet on but he’d match
you. He ketched a frog one day, and took him home, and said
he cal’klated to edercate him; and so he never done nothing for
three months but set in his back yard and learn that frog to jump.
And you bet you he <em>did</em> learn him, too. He’d give him a little
punch behind, and the next minute you’d see that frog whirling in
the air like a doughnut—see him turn one summerset, or maybe a
couple, if he got a good start, and come down flat-footed and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
right, like a cat. He got him up so in the matter of catching
flies, and kept him in practice so constant, that he’d nail a fly
every time as far as he could see him. Smiley said all a frog
wanted was education, and he could do most any thing—and I
believe him. Why, I’ve seen him set Dan’l Webster down here
on this floor—Dan’l Webster was the name of the frog—and sing
out, “Flies, Dan’l, flies!” and quicker’n you could wink, he’d
spring straight up, and snake a fly off’n the counter there, and
flop down on the floor again as solid as a gob of mud, and fall to
scratching the side of his head with his hind foot as indifferent
as if he hadn’t no idea he’d been doin’ any more’n any frog might
do. You never see a frog so modest and straightforward as he was,
for all he was so gifted. And when it come to fair and square
jumping on a dead level, he could get over more ground at one
straddle than any animal of his breed you ever see. Jumping on
a dead level was his strong suit, you understand; and when it come
to that, Smiley would ante up money on him as long as he had a
red. Smiley was monstrous proud of that frog, and well he might
be, for fellers that had traveled and been everywheres, all said
he laid over any frog that ever <em>they</em> see.</p>

<p>Well, Smiley kept the beast in a little <a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref908">lattice box</a>, and he used
to fetch him down town sometimes and lay for a bet. One day a
feller—a stranger in the camp, he was—come across him with his
box, and says:</p>

<p>“What might it be that you’ve got in the box?”</p>

<p>And Smiley says, sorter indifferent like, “It might be a parrot,
or it might be a canary, maybe, but it an’t—it’s only just a frog.”</p>

<p>And the feller took it and looked at it careful, and turned it
round this way and that, and says, “H’m—so ’tis. Well, what’s
<em>he</em> good for?”</p>

<p>“Well,” Smiley says, easy and careless, “He’s good enough
for <em>one</em> thing, I should judge—he can outjump any frog in Calaveras
county.”</p>

<p>The feller took the box again, and took another long, particular
look, and give it back to Smiley, and says, very deliberate, “Well,
I don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n any other
frog.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe you don’t,” Smiley says. “Maybe you understand
frogs, and maybe you don’t understand ’em; maybe you’ve had
experience, and maybe you an’t only a amature, as it were. Anyways,
I’ve got <em>my</em> opinion, and I’ll risk forty dollars that he can
outjump any frog in Calaveras county.”</p>

<p>And the feller studied a minute, and then says, kinder sad
like, “Well, I’m only a stranger here, and I ain’t got no frog; but
if I had a frog, I’d bet you.”</p>

<p>And then Smiley says, “That’s all right—that’s all right—if
you’ll hold my box a minute, I’ll go and get you a frog.” And
so the feller took the box, and put up his forty dollars along with
Smiley’s, and set down to wait.</p>

<p>So he set there a good while thinking and thinking to hisself
and then he got the frog out and prized his mouth open and took
a teaspoon and filled him full of quail shot—filled him pretty near
up to his chin—and set him on the floor. Smiley he went to the
swamp and slopped around in the mud for a long time, and finally
he ketched a frog, and fetched him in, and give him to this feller,
and says:</p>

<p>“Now, if you’re ready, set him alongside of Dan’l, with his
forepaws just even with Dan’l, and I’ll give the word.” Then he
says, “One—two—three—jump!” and him and the feller touched
up the frogs from behind, and the new frog hopped off, but Dan’l
give a heave, and hysted up his shoulders—so—like a Frenchman,
but it wan’t no use—he couldn’t budge; he was planted as solid
as an anvil, and he couldn’t no more stir than if he was <a href="#phrases76" title="List of phrases" id="ref909">anchored
out</a>. Smiley was a good deal surprised, and he was disgusted
too, but he didn’t have no idea what the matter was, of course.</p>

<p>The feller took the money and started away; and when he
was going out at the door, he sorter jerked his thumb over his
shoulders—this way—at Dan’l, and says again, very deliberate,
“Well, <em>I</em> don’t see no p’ints about that frog that’s any better’n
any other frog.”</p>

<p>Smiley he stood scratching his head and looking down at Dan’l
a long time, and at last he says, “I do wonder what in the nation
that frog throw’d off for—I wonder if there an’t something the
matter with him—he ’pears to look mighty baggy, somehow.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
And he ketched Dan’l by the nap of the neck, and lifted him up
and says, “Why, blame my cats, if he don’t weigh five pound!”
and turned him upside down, and he belched out a double handful
of shot. And then he see how it was, and he was the maddest
man—he set the frog down and took out after that feller, but he
never ketched him. And—</p>

<p>[Here Simon Wheeler heard his name called from the front
yard, and got up to see what was wanted.] And turning to me
as he moved away, he said, “Just set where you are, stranger, and
rest easy—I ain’t going to be gone a second.”</p>

<p>But, by your leave, I did not think that a continuation of the
history of the enterprising vagabond <em>Jim</em> Smiley would be likely
to afford me much information concerning the Rev. <em>Leonidas W.</em>
Smiley, and so I started away.</p>

<p>At the door I met the sociable Wheeler returning, and he buttonholed
me and recommenced:</p>

<p>“Well, thish-yer Smiley had a yaller one-eyed cow that didn’t
have no tail, only jest a short stump like a bannanner, and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, hang Smiley and his afflicted cow!” I muttered, good-naturedly,
and bidding the old gentleman good-day, I departed.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835-1910), better known by
his pen name Mark Twain, is America’s greatest humorous writer. Like
Walt Whitman he was of humble parentage. He was born in the
village of Florida, Missouri, and at the age of four years, moved with his
parents to the river town of Hannibal, which he immortalized in his two
most popular books, <cite>Tom Sawyer</cite> and <cite>Huckleberry Finn</cite>. He became a
printer and later a pilot on a Mississippi steamboat. For a few years he
served as assistant to his brother who was secretary of the Territory of
Nevada. This brought him in touch with the gold fields of the West, and he
set out to make his fortune in a mining camp. He found only a very small
amount of gold, but his wonderful experiences in the West furnish the basis
of some of his most popular stories and books, such as “The Celebrated
Jumping Frog” and <cite>Roughing It</cite>. As a newspaper reporter he chose the
pen name Mark Twain, an old river expression, meaning the mark that registers
two (twain) fathoms (twelve feet) of water. His start to literary fame
came with the publication of the story “The Celebrated Jumping Frog.”
Later he traveled through Europe and the Holy Land, paying his expenses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
by means of a series of letters describing his trip, written for a San Francisco
newspaper. These letters were afterward collected in a book called <cite>The Innocents
Abroad</cite>, a delightfully humorous collection of descriptive sketches.
For a time he was part owner and associate editor of the <cite>Buffalo Express</cite>,
but the investment was not profitable and he spent much of his time on the
lecture platform. He died at Redding, Connecticut, in his seventy-fifth year.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) was born in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, the son of a Congregational minister. He attended
Phillips Exeter Academy and was graduated from Harvard College in the
famous class of 1829. After studying medicine and anatomy in Paris, he
began practicing in Boston. Later he was made professor of anatomy
and physiology at Dartmouth College, and afterwards at Harvard. In 1850<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
he wrote the poem “Old Ironsides” as a protest against the dismantling
of the historic battleship <i>Constitution</i> which lay in the harbor. It stirred
the entire country so that the Secretary of the Navy found it advisable
to recall the order he had issued. Like Bryant, Holmes was a poet on occasion,
not by profession. For more than forty years after he entered on his
duties at Harvard he delivered his four lectures a week eight months of
the year, and President Eliot bore witness that he was not less skillful
with the scalpel and the microscope than with the pen.</p>

<p>When Lowell was offered the editorship of the <cite>Atlantic Monthly</cite>, he
made it a condition of his acceptance that Holmes should be a contributor.
The result was a series of articles entitled <cite>The Autocrat of the Breakfast
Table</cite>. Among his poems, the best known are his “Chambered Nautilus,”
“The Height of the Ridiculous”, “The Deacon’s Masterpiece” (The One
Hoss Shay), and short poems in celebration of various occasions. Among
these are some forty poems read at anniversaries of his college class, notably
the one beginning: “Has any old fellow got mixed with the boys?” In this
he refers playfully to the author of “America” as one whom “Fate tried to
conceal by naming him Smith.”</p>

<p>He wrote several novels, but it is as the author of the <cite>Autocrat</cite> series
and by his humorous poems that he will be best remembered by his readers.
By his personal associates he was most fondly remembered for his sunny,
cheerful disposition and his witty conversation.</p>

“height of the ridiculous”? 2. What incidents are related that seem to
show him to be right in this estimate? 3. What opinion of the poet does
the poem give you? 4. In what state of mind do you think of him as writing

<h4>THE GIFT OF THE MAGI</h4>

<p class="author">O. HENRY</p>

<p>One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty
cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time
by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher
until one’s cheeks burned with the silent <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref914">imputation of parsimony</a>
that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it.
One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be
Christmas.</p>

<p>There was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby
little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref915">instigates the
moral reflection</a> that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles,
with sniffles predominating.</p>

<p>While the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from
the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished
flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref916">beggar description</a>,
but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref917">mendicancy
squad</a>.</p>

<p>In the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter
would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger
could coax a ring. Also <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref918">appertaining thereunto</a> was a card bearing
the name “Mr. James Dillingham Young.”</p>

<p>The “Dillingham” had been flung to the breeze during a former
period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per
week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of
“Dillingham” looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously
of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever
Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his
flat above he was called “Jim” and greatly hugged by Mrs. James
Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is
all very good.</p>

<p>Della finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a
gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow
would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to
buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could
for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn’t go
far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They
always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim.
Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice
for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just
a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by
Jim.</p>

<p>There was a pier-glass between the windows of the room.
Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin
and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref919">a rapid
sequence of longitudinal strips</a>, obtain a fairly accurate conception
of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.</p>

<p>Suddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the
glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost
its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her
hair and let it fall to its full length.</p>

<p>Now, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham
Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim’s
gold watch that had been his father’s and his grandfather’s. The
other was Della’s hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat
across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the
window some day to dry <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref920">just to depreciate</a> Her Majesty’s jewels
and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures
piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his
watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard
from envy.</p>

<p>So now Della’s beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and
shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her
knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she
did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a
minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn
red carpet.</p>

<p>On went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[543]</a></span>
With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her
eyes, she fluttered out of the door and down the stairs to the
street.</p>

<p>Where she stopped, the sign read: “Mme. Sofronie. Hair
Goods of All Kinds.” One flight up Della ran, and collected herself,
panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked
the “Sofronie.”</p>

<p>“Will you buy my hair?” asked Della.</p>

<p>“I buy hair,” said Madame. “Take yer hat off and let’s have
a sight at the looks of it.”</p>

<p>Down rippled the brown cascade.</p>

<p>“Twenty dollars,” said Madame, lifting the mass with a practiced
hand.</p>

<p>“Give it to me quick,” said Della.</p>

<p>Oh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget
the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim’s
present.</p>

<p>She found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and
no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and
she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob
chain, simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value
by substance alone and not by <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref921">meretricious ornamentation</a>—as all
good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As
soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim’s. It was like him.
Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one
dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with
the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly
anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch
was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old
leather strap that he used in place of a chain.</p>

<p>When Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little
to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted
the gas and went to work <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref922">repairing the ravages</a> made by generosity
added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear
friends—a mammoth task.</p>

<p>Within forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying
curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span>
She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully,
and critically.</p>

<p>“If Jim doesn’t kill me,” she said to herself, “before he takes
a second look at me, he’ll say I look like a Coney Island chorus
girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and
eighty-seven cents?”</p>

<p>At 7 o’clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on
the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.</p>

<p>Jim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand
and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always
entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on
the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had
a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday
things, and now she whispered: “Please God, make him think I
am still pretty.”</p>

<p>The door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked
thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and
to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat
and he was without gloves.</p>

<p>Jim stopped inside the door, as <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref923">immovable as a setter</a> at the
scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an
expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her.
It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor
any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He
simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his
face.</p>

<p>Della wriggled off the table and went for him.</p>

<p>“Jim, darling,” she cried, “don’t look at me that way. I had
my hair cut off and sold it because I couldn’t live through Christmas
without giving you a present. It’ll grow out again—you
won’t mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully
fast. Say ‘Merry Christmas,’ Jim, and let’s be happy. You
don’t know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I’ve got
for you.”</p>

<p>“You’ve cut off your hair?” asked Jim laboriously, as if he
had not arrived at that <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref924">patent fact</a> yet, even after the hardest
mental labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cut it off and sold it,” said Della. “Don’t you like me just
as well, anyhow? I’m me without my hair, ain’t I?”</p>

<p>Jim looked about the room curiously.</p>

<p>“You say your hair is gone?” he said, with an air almost of
idiocy.</p>

<p>“You needn’t look for it,” said Della. “It’s sold, I tell you—sold
and gone, too. It’s Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for
it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered,”
she went on with a sudden serious sweetness, “but nobody could
ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?”</p>

<p>Out of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded
his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny
some <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref925">inconsequential object</a> in the other direction. Eight dollars
a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician
or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi
brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark
assertion will be illuminated later on.</p>

<p>Jim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it
upon the table.</p>

<p>“Don’t make any mistake, Dell,” he said, “about me. I don’t
think there’s anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a
shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you’ll
unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while
at first.”</p>

<p>White fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And
then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine
change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate
employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.</p>

<p>For there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back,
that Della had worshiped for long in a Broadway window.
Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jeweled rims—just the
shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive
combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and
yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And
now they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned
the coveted adornments were gone.</p>

<p>But she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: “My hair grows so
fast, Jim!”</p>

<p>And then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried,
“Oh, oh!”</p>

<p>Jim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to
him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed
to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it.
You’ll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give
me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it.”</p>

<p>Instead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put
his hands under the back of his head and smiled.</p>

<p>“Dell,” said he, “let’s put our Christmas presents away and
keep ’em a while. They’re too nice to use just at present. I sold
the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose
you put the chops on.”</p>

<p>The magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise
men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented
the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their
gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of
exchange in <a href="#phrases78" title="List of phrases" id="ref926">case of duplication</a>. And here I have lamely related
to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat
who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures
of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days
let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest.
Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere
they are wisest. They are the magi.</p>

<h4>WOUTER VAN TWILLER</h4>

<p class="author">WASHINGTON IRVING</p>

<p>It was in the year of our Lord 1629 that Mynheer Wouter Van
Twiller was appointed governor of the province of Nieuw-Nederlandts,
<a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref927">under the commission and control</a> of their High Mightinesses,
the Lords States General of the United Netherlands, and
the privileged West India Company.</p>

<p>This renowned old gentleman arrived at New-Amsterdam in
the merry month of June, the sweetest month in all the year;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
when Dan Apollo seems to dance up the <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref928">transparent firmament</a>—when
the robin, the thrush, and a thousand other wanton songsters
made the woods resound with <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref929">amorous ditties</a>, and the
luxurious little boblincon revels among the clover blossoms of
the meadows—all which happy coincidence persuaded the old
dames of New-Amsterdam, who were skilled in the art of foretelling
events, that this was to be a happy and prosperous administration.</p>

<p>The renowned Wouter (or Walter) Van Twiller was descended
from a long line of Dutch burgomasters, who had <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref930">successively
dozed away</a> their lives and grown fat upon the bench of magistracy
in Rotterdam; and who had comported themselves with
such singular wisdom and propriety, that they were never either
heard or talked of—which, next to being universally applauded,
should be the object of ambition of all sage magistrates and rulers.</p>

<p>There are two opposite ways by which some men get into
notice—one by talking a vast deal and thinking a little, and the
other by holding their tongues, and not thinking at all. By the
first, many a <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref931">vaporing, superficial pretender</a> acquires the reputation
of a man of quick parts—by the other, many a vacant
dunderpate, like the owl, the stupidest of birds, comes to be complimented
by a discerning world with all the attributes of wisdom.
This, by the way, is a mere casual remark, which I would not for
the universe have it thought I apply to Governor Van Twiller.
On the contrary, he was a very wise Dutchman, for he never said
a foolish thing—and of such invincible gravity, that he was never
known to laugh, or even to smile, through the course of a long
and prosperous life. Certain, however, it is, there never was a
matter proposed, however simple, and on which your common
narrow-minded mortals would rashly determine at the first glance,
but what the renowned Wouter put on a mighty, mysterious,
vacant kind of look, shook his capacious head, and, having smoked
for five minutes with redoubled earnestness, sagely observed that
he had his doubts about the matter—which in process of time
gained him the character of a man slow in belief, and not easily
imposed on.</p>

<p>The person of this illustrious old gentleman was as regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
formed and <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref932">nobly proportioned</a>, as though it had been molded
by the hands of some cunning Dutch statuary, as a model of
majesty and lordly grandeur. He was exactly five feet six inches
in height, and six feet five inches in circumference. His head was
a perfect sphere, and of such <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref933">stupendous dimensions</a> that Dame
Nature, with all her sex’s ingenuity, would have been puzzled to
construct a neck capable of supporting it; wherefore she wisely
declined the attempt, and settled it firmly on the top of his back-bone,
just between the shoulders. His body was of an oblong
form, particularly capacious at bottom; which was wisely ordered
by Providence, seeing that he was a man of sedentary habits,
and very averse to the idle labor of walking. His legs, though
exceeding short, were sturdy in proportion to the weight they had
to sustain; so that when erect he had not a little the appearance of
a robustious beer-barrel, standing on skids. His face, that <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref934">infallible
index</a> of the mind, presented a vast expanse, perfectly
unfurrowed or deformed by any of those lines and angles which
disfigure the human countenance with what is termed expression.
Two small gray eyes twinkled feebly in the midst, like two stars
of <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref935">lesser magnitude</a> in the hazy firmament; and his full-fed cheeks,
which seemed to have taken toll of everything that went into his
mouth, were curiously mottled and streaked with dusky red, like a
Spitzenberg apple.</p>

<p>His habits were as regular as his person. He daily took his
four stated meals, appropriating exactly an hour to each; he
smoked and doubted eight hours, and he slept the remaining
twelve of the four and twenty. Such was the renowned Wouter
Van Twiller—a true philosopher, for his mind was either elevated
above, or tranquilly settled below, the cares and perplexities of
this world. He had lived in it for years, without feeling the least
curiosity to know whether the sun revolved round it, or it round
the sun; and he had watched, for at least half a century, the
smoke curling from his pipe to the ceiling; without once troubling
his head with any of those numerous theories, by which a philosopher
would have perplexed his brain, in accounting for its rising
above the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p>In his council he presided with great state and solemnity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
He sat in a huge chair of solid oak, hewn in the celebrated forest
of the Hague, <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref936">fabricated by an experienced timmerman</a> of Amsterdam,
and curiously carved about the arms and feet, into exact
imitations of gigantic eagle’s claws. Instead of a scepter, he
swayed a long Turkish pipe, wrought with jasmine and amber,
which had been presented to a Stadtholder of Holland, at the
conclusion of a treaty with one of the petty Barbary powers. In
this stately chair would he sit, and this magnificent pipe would
he smoke, shaking his right knee with a constant motion, and
fixing his eye for hours together upon a little print of Amsterdam,
which hung in a black frame against the opposite wall of the
council chamber. Nay, it has even been said, that when any
<a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref937">deliberation of extraordinary length</a> and intricacy was on the
carpet, the renowned Wouter would absolutely shut his eyes for
full two hours at a time, that he might not be disturbed by external
objects—and at such times the internal commotion of his
mind was evinced by certain regular guttural sounds, which his
admirers declared were merely the noise of conflict, made by his
contending doubts and opinions.</p>

<p>It is with infinite difficulty I have been enabled to collect these
biographical anecdotes of the great man under consideration.
The facts respecting him were so scattered and vague, and divers
of them so questionable in <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref938">point of authenticity</a>, that I have had
to give up the search after many, and decline the admission of
still more, which would have tended to heighten the coloring of
his portrait.</p>

<p>I have been the more anxious to delineate fully the person
and habits of the renowned Van Twiller, from the consideration
that he was not only the first, but also the best governor that ever
presided over this ancient and respectable province; and so tranquil
and benevolent was his reign, that I do not find throughout
the whole of it, a single instance of any offender being brought to
punishment—a most indubitable sign of a merciful governor, and
a case unparalleled, excepting in the reign of the illustrious King
Log, from whom, it is hinted, the renowned Van Twiller was a
lineal descendant.</p>

<p>The very outset of the career of this excellent magistrate was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
distinguished by an <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref939">example of legal acumen</a>, that gave flattering
presage of a wise and equitable administration. The morning
after he had been solemnly installed in office, and at the moment
that he was making his breakfast, from a prodigious earthen dish,
filled with milk and Indian pudding, he was suddenly interrupted
by the appearance of one Wandle Schoonhoven, a very important
old burgher of New-Amsterdam, who complained bitterly of one
Barent Bleecker, inasmuch as he fraudulently refused to come to
a settlement of accounts, seeing that there was a heavy balance
in favor of the said Wandle. Governor Van Twiller, as I have
already observed, was a man of few words; he was likewise a
mortal enemy to multiplying writings—or being disturbed at his
breakfast. Having listened attentively to the statement of
Wandle Schoonhoven, giving an occasional grunt, as he shoveled
a spoonful of Indian pudding into his mouth—either as a sign that
he relished the dish, or comprehended the story—he called unto
him his constable, and pulling out of his breeches pocket a huge
jack-knife, despatched it after the defendant as a summons, accompanied
by his tobacco-box as a warrant.</p>

<p>This summary process was as effectual in those simple days
as was the seal ring of the great Haroun Alraschid among the
true believers. The two parties being confronted before him,
each produced a book of accounts written in a language and character
that would have puzzled any but a High Dutch commentator,
or a learned decipherer of Egyptian obelisks, to understand.
The sage Wouter took them one after the other, and having
poised them in his hands, and attentively counted over the number
of leaves, fell straightway into a very great doubt, and smoked
for half an hour without saying a word; at length, laying his
finger beside his nose, and shutting his eyes for a moment, with
the air of a man who has just caught a subtle idea by the tail, he
slowly took his pipe from his mouth, puffed forth a column of
tobacco-smoke, and with marvelous gravity and solemnity pronounced—that
having carefully counted over the leaves and
weighed the books, it was found, that one was just as thick and
as heavy as the other—therefore it was the final opinion of the
court that the accounts were equally balanced—therefore Wandle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
should give Barent a receipt, and Barent should give Wandle a
receipt—and the constable should pay the costs.</p>

<p>This decision being straightway made known, diffused general
joy throughout New-Amsterdam, for the people immediately perceived
that they had a very wise and equitable magistrate to rule
over them. But its happiest effect was, that not another law-suit
took place throughout the whole of his administration—and the
office of constable fell into such decay that there was not one of
those <a href="#phrases79" title="List of phrases" id="ref940">losel scouts</a> known in the province for many years. I am
the more particular in dwelling on this transaction, not only
because I deem it one of the most sage and righteous judgments
on record, and well worthy the attention of modern magistrates,
but because it was a miraculous event in the history of the renowned
Wouter—being the only time he was ever known to come
to a decision in the whole course of his life.</p>

<h4>MAKERS OF THE FLAG</h4>

<p class="author">FRANKLIN K. LANE</p>

<p>This morning as I passed into the Land Office, the Flag
dropped me a most <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref941">cordial salutation</a>, and from its rippling folds
I heard it say: “Good morning, Mr. Flag Maker.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, Old Glory,” I said; “aren’t you mistaken?
I am not the President of the United States, nor a member of
Congress, nor even a general in the army. I am only a Government
clerk.”</p>

<p>“I greet you again, Mr. Flag Maker,” replied the gay voice;
“I know you well. You are the man who worked in the <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref942">swelter
of yesterday</a> straightening out the tangle of that farmer’s homestead
in Idaho, or perhaps you found the mistake in the <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref943">Indian
contract</a> in Oklahoma, or helped to clear that patent for the hopeful
inventor in New York, or pushed the opening of that new
ditch in Colorado, or made that mine in Illinois more safe, or
brought relief to the old soldier in Wyoming. No matter, whichever
one of these <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref944">beneficent individuals</a> you may happen to be, I
give you greeting, Mr. Flag Maker.”</p>

<p>I was about to pass on, when the Flag stopped me with these
words:</p>

<p>“Yesterday the President spoke a word that made happier the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
future of ten million peons in Mexico; but that act looms no
larger on the flag than the struggle which the boy in Georgia is
making to win the Corn Club prize this summer.</p>

<p>“Yesterday the Congress spoke a word which will open the
door of Alaska; but a mother in Michigan worked from sunrise
until far into the night, to give her boy an education. She, too, is
making the flag.</p>

<p>“Yesterday we made a new law to prevent <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref945">financial panics</a>,
and yesterday, maybe, a school teacher in Ohio taught his first
letters to a boy who will one day write a song that will give cheer
to the millions of our race. We are all making the flag.”</p>

<p>“But,” I said impatiently, “these people were only working!”
Then came a great shout from the Flag:</p>

<p>“The work that we do is the making of the Flag.</p>

<p>“I am not the flag; not at all. I am nothing more than its
shadow.</p>

<p>“I am whatever you make me, nothing more.</p>

<p>“I am your belief in yourself, your dream of what a People
may become.</p>

<p>“I live a changing life, a life of moods and passions, of heartbreaks
and tired muscles.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I am strong with pride, when workmen do an
honest piece of work, fitting rails together truly.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I droop, for then purpose has gone from me, and
<a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref946">cynically I play the coward</a>.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I am loud, garish, and full of that <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref947">ego that blasts
judgment</a>.</p>

<p>“But always, I am all that you hope to be, and have the courage
to try for.</p>

<p>“I am song and fear, struggle and panic, and ennobling
hope.</p>

<p>“I am the day’s work of the weakest man, and the largest
dream of the most daring.</p>

<p>“I am the Constitution and the courts, the statutes and the
statute makers, soldier and dreadnaught, drayman and street
sweep, cook, counselor, and clerk.</p>

<p>“I am the battle of yesterday, and the <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref948">mistake of tomorrow</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am the mystery of the men who do without knowing why.</p>

<p>“I am the <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref949">clutch of an idea</a>, and the reasoned <a href="#phrases80" title="List of phrases" id="ref950">purpose of
resolution</a>.</p>

<p>“I am no more than what you believe me to be, and I am all
that you believe I can be.</p>

<p>“I am what you make me, nothing more.</p>

<p>“I swing before your eyes as a bright gleam of color, a symbol
of yourself, the pictured suggestion of that big thing which makes
this nation. My stars and my stripes are your dream and your
labors. They are bright with cheer, brilliant with courage, firm
with faith, because you have made them so out of your hearts.
For you are the makers of the flag and it is well that you glory in
the making.”</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Walt Whitman (1819-1892) was born in Huntington, Long
Island, and educated in the public schools of Brooklyn. He left school at
the early age of thirteen to make his own way in life. At different times
he was school teacher, carpenter, builder, journalist, and poet. During
the Civil War he became a volunteer nurse in and about Washington, D. C.,
and the story of his unselfish hospital service is one of the most inspiring
that has come down to us from that war. Lincoln said of him, “Well, <em>he</em>
looks like a <em>man</em>!”</p>

<p>Two points about Whitman are worthy of notice. The first is that he
was a man of intensely democratic sympathies. He wrote of “the dear love
of comrades” as the real means for bringing about a better understanding
among men of every nation, a better government, and the end of war.
He loved every part of America, and all America’s sons and daughters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span></p>

<p>The word “democracy” constantly occurs in his poetry and his prose, and by
it he means the cultivation of love and coöperation among men. He had
a vision of the time when autocratic government, and all forms of selfishness,
should cease among men; like Burns, he dwelt on the time when men
all over the world should be brothers.</p>

<p>The second point is closely related to the first. In his dislike for conventional
and exclusive life he objected even to the <em>form</em> developed for
poetry through centuries. He was a lover of freedom, even in writing. So
he rarely uses rimes and stanzas. He calls his form “chants,” and so they
are, chants of human brotherhood and sympathy.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Who is it that the poet hears singing? 2. In stanza 1,
what “varied carols” does he hear? 3. What do you think was the poet’s
underlying idea in writing this poem? 4. Do you think that he meant to
point out that the road to happiness is the road to work?</p>

<h4>THE BEANFIELD</h4>

<p class="author">HENRY D. THOREAU</p>

<p>Before I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve
dollars by some honest and agreeable method, in order to meet
my unusual expenses, I planted about two acres and a half chiefly
with beans, but a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips.</p>

<p>Meanwhile my beans, the length of whose rows, added together,
was seven miles, were impatient to be hoed, for the earliest
had grown considerably before the latest were in the ground;
indeed they were not easily to be put off. What was the meaning
of this so steady and self-respecting, this small <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref959">Herculean labor</a>,
I knew not. I came to love my rows, my beans, though so many
more than I wanted. They attached me to the earth, and so I
got <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref960">strength like Antaeus</a>. But why should I raise them? Only
Heaven knows. This was my curious labor all summer—to make
this portion of the earth’s surface, which had yielded only cinquefoil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
blackberries, johnswort, and the like, before, sweet wild fruits
and pleasant flowers, produce instead this pulse. What shall I
learn of beans or beans of me? I cherish them, I hoe them, early
and late I have an eye to them; and this is my day’s work. It is a
fine broad leaf to look on. My <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref961">auxiliaries are the dews</a> and rains
which water this dry soil, and what fertility is in the soil itself,
which for the most part is <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref962">lean and effete</a>. My enemies are worms,
cool days and, most of all, woodchucks. The last have nibbled
for me a quarter of an acre clean. But what right had I to oust
johnswort and the rest, and break up their ancient herb garden?
Soon, however, the remaining beans will be too tough for them,
and go forward to meet new foes.</p>

<p>I planted about two acres and a half of upland. Before any
woodchuck or squirrel had run across the road, or the sun had
gotten above the shrub-oaks, while all the dew was on—I would
advise you to do all your work if possible while the dew is on—I
began to <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref963">level the ranks</a> of haughty weeds in my beanfield and
to throw dust upon their heads. Early in the morning I worked
barefooted, dabbling like a <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref964">plastic artist</a> in the dewy and crumbling
sand, but later in the day the sun blistered my feet. The
sun lighted me to hoe beans, pacing slowly backward and forward
over that yellow gravelly upland, between the long green rows,
fifteen rods, the one end terminating in a shrub-oak copse where I
could rest in the shade the other in a blackberry field where the
green berries deepened their tints by the time I had made another
round. Removing the weeds putting fresh soil about the bean
stems and encouraging this weed which I had sown, making the
yellow soil <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref965">express its summer thought</a> in bean leaves and blossoms
rather than in wormwood and piper and millet grass, making
the earth say beans instead of grass—this was my daily work. As
I had little aid from horses or cattle, or hired men or boys, or
improved <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref966">implements of husbandry</a>, I was much slower, and became
much more intimate with my beans than usual.</p>

<p>It was a singular experience, that long acquaintance which I
cultivated with beans, what with planting, and hoeing, and harvesting,
and threshing, and picking over and selling them—the
last was the hardest of all—I might add eating for I did taste.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[561]</a></span>
I was determined to know beans. When they were growing, I used
to hoe from five o’clock in the morning till noon, and commonly
spent the rest of the day about other affairs. Consider the <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref967">intimate
and curious acquaintance</a> one makes with various kinds of
weeds. That’s Roman wormwood—that’s pigweed—that’s sorrel—that’s
piper-grass—have at him, chop him up, turn his roots
upward to the sun, don’t let him have a fiber in the shade; if you
do he’ll turn himself t’other side up and be as green as a leek in
two days. A long war, not with cranes, but with weeds, those
Trojans who had sun and rain and dews on their side. Daily the
beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin
the ranks of their enemies, filling up the trenches with weedy
dead. Many a lusty <a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref968">crest-waving Hector</a>, that towered a whole
foot above his crowding comrades, fell before my weapon and
rolled in the dust.</p>

<p>My farm outgoes for the season were, for implements, seed,
work, etc., $14.72½. I got twelve bushels of beans and eighteen
bushels of potatoes, besides some peas and sweet corn. The
yellow corn and turnips were too late to come to anything. My
whole income from the farm was—</p>

<table summary="An income and expenditure account for the farm">
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td class="right">$23.44&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Deducting the outgoes</td>
    <td class="right">&nbsp;&nbsp;14.72½</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="total">There are left</td>
    <td class="right total">$&nbsp;&nbsp;8.71½</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This is the result of my experience in raising beans. Plant
the common small white bush bean about the first of June, in
rows three feet by eighteen inches apart, being careful to select
fresh, round, and unmixed seed. First look out for worms, and
<a href="#phrases83" title="List of phrases" id="ref969">supply vacancies</a> by planting anew. Then look out for woodchucks,
if it is an exposed place, for they will nibble off the
earliest tender leaves almost clean as they go; and again, when
the young tendrils make their appearance, they have notice of it,
and will shear them off with both buds and young pods, sitting
erect like a squirrel. But above all, harvest as early as possible,
if you would escape frosts and have a fair and salable crop; you
may save much loss by this means.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862) was born in Concord,
Massachusetts, and was educated in the village schools and later at Harvard
University. He was an intimate friend of Emerson, Hawthorne, and the
Alcotts. With the help of Emerson, he built a cottage beside a pond in
Walden Woods near Concord where he lived alone, planted beans, caught
fish, and for the most part lived on the products of the soil, cultivated by his
own hands. In his book, <cite>Walden, or Life in the Woods</cite>, he gives a detailed
account of his observations and experiences. Other books by Thoreau are
<cite>A Week on the Concord and the Merrimack Rivers</cite>, <cite>The Maine Woods</cite>, etc.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Why did Thoreau wish to earn some extra money? 2.
What seeds did he plant? 3. The author likens the hoeing of the beans
to a “Herculean labor”; explain this reference. 4. What were Thoreau’s
auxiliaries? His enemies? 5. According to the author, what is the best
time to work in the garden? 6. How did he come “to know beans” so
well? 7. Explain the metaphor referring to the weeds as Trojans. 8. How
much did the author clear on his garden? 9. Do you think the amount
made was worth the labor put into it? 10. Tell one of your experiences
with a garden.</p>

<p><b>Historical Note.</b> Old Ironsides was the popular name given the U. S.
frigate <i>Constitution</i>. It was proposed by the Secretary of the Navy to dispose
of the ship, as it had become unfit for service. Popular sentiment did
not approve of this; it was felt that a ship which had been the pride of the
nation should continue to be the property of the Navy and that it should
be rebuilt for service when needed. Holmes wrote this poem at the time
when the matter was being widely discussed.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. In what spirit was this poem written? 2. What was the
motive which inspired it? 3. Do you think the poet really means it when
he cries, “Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!”? Can you give some other
instance of irony? 4. As you read this poem, do you think of the frigate
as an inanimate object or does it seem personified? 5. What is meant by
“meteor of the ocean wave”? 6. Who are the “harpies of the shore”? The
“eagle of the sea”? 7. What does the poet say would be better than to have
the ship dismantled? 8. Do you think this a fitting end for a ship of war?
9. Read the story of the fight between the <i>Constitution</i> and the <i>Guerriére</i>
given in your history and be prepared to tell it in class. Why did the
nation have particular pride in this achievement? 10. Pronounce the following:
ensign; beneath.</p>

<h4>THE AMERICAN FLAG</h4>

<p class="author">HENRY WARD BEECHER</p>

<p>A thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation’s flag, sees not the
flag only, but the nation itself; and whatever may be its symbols,
its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the government, the principles,
the truths, the history, which belong to the nation which
sets it forth.</p>

<p>When the French tricolor rolls out to the wind, we see France.
When the new-found Italian flag is unfurled, we see <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref994">resurrected
Italy</a>. When the other three-cornered Hungarian flag shall be
lifted to the wind, we shall see in it the long buried but never dead
principles of Hungarian liberty. When the united crosses of St.
Andrew and St. George on a fiery ground set forth the banner of
Old England, we see not the cloth merely; there rises up before
the mind the noble aspect of that monarchy, which, more than any
other on the globe, has advanced its banner for liberty, law, and
national prosperity.</p>

<p>This nation has a banner, too; and wherever it streamed
abroad, men saw daybreak bursting on their eyes, for the American
flag has been the symbol of liberty, and men rejoiced in it.
Not another flag on the globe had such an errand, or went forth
upon the sea, carrying everywhere, the world around, such hope
for the captive, and such <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref995">glorious tidings</a>. The stars upon it were
to the pining nations like the morning stars of God, and the stripes
upon it were beams of morning light.</p>

<p>As at early dawn the stars stand first, and then it grows light,
and then as the sun advances, that light breaks into banks and
streaming lines of color, the glowing red and intense white striving
together and <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref996">ribbing the horizon</a> with <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref997">bars effulgent</a>, so on the
American flag, stars and beams of many-colored light shine out
together. And wherever the flag comes, and men behold it, they
see in its <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref998">sacred emblazonry</a> no rampant lion and fierce eagle, but
only <span class="smcapuc">LIGHT</span>, and every fold significant of liberty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of this banner is all on one side. Under it rode
Washington and his armies; before it Burgoyne laid down his
arms. It waved on the highlands at West Point; it floated over
old Fort Montgomery. When Arnold would have surrendered
these valuable fortresses and <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref999">precious legacies</a>, his night was
turned into day, and his treachery was driven away by the beams
of light from this starry banner.</p>

<p>It cheered our army, driven from New York, in their solitary
pilgrimage through New Jersey. It streamed in light over Valley
Forge and Morristown. It crossed the waters rolling with ice at
Trenton; and when its stars gleamed in the cold morning with victory,
a new day of hope dawned on the despondency of the nation.
And when, at length, the long years of war were drawing to a close,
underneath the folds of this immortal banner sat Washington
while Yorktown surrendered its hosts, and our Revolutionary
struggles ended with victory.</p>

<p>Let us then twine each thread of the <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref1000">glorious tissue</a> of our
country’s flag about our heartstrings; and looking upon our homes
and catching the spirit that breathes upon us from the battlefields
of our fathers, let us resolve, come <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref1001">weal or woe</a>, we will, in life and
in death, now and forever, stand by the Stars and Stripes. They
have been unfurled from the snows of Canada to the plains of New
Orleans, in the halls of the Montezumas and amid the solitude of
every sea; and everywhere, as the <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref1002">luminous symbol</a> of resistless
and <a href="#phrases88" title="List of phrases" id="ref1003">beneficent power</a>, they have led the brave to victory and to
glory. They have floated over our cradles; let it be our prayer
and our struggle that they shall float over our graves.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Joseph Rodman Drake (1795-1820), whose name is inseparably
associated with that of his friend, Fitz-Greene Halleck, was an American
poet. These two able poets together contributed a series of forty poems to
the <cite>New York Evening Post</cite>. Among these was “The American Flag,” the
last four lines of which were written by Halleck, to replace those written by
Drake:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“As fixed as yonder orb divine,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">That saw thy bannered blaze unfurled,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall thy proud stars resplendent shine,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">The guard and glory of the world.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Drake was a youth of many graces of both mind and body, who wrote
verses as a bird sings—for the pure joy of it. His career was cut short
by death when he was only twenty-five years old. Of him Halleck wrote:</p>

flag has a part? 6. Note all the names the poet gives to the flag; which of
these do you like best? 7. Can you give other names that are applied
to our flag? 8. What feeling caused this poem to be written? 9. What

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biographical and Historical Note.</b> Francis Scott Key (1780-1843), an
American lawyer and poet, was a native of Maryland. “The Star-Spangled
Banner” made him famous.</p>

<p>The incidents referred to in this poem occurred during the war of 1812.
In August, 1814, a strong force of British entered Washington and burned
the Capitol, the White House, and many other public buildings. On September
13 the British admiral moved his fleet into position to attack Fort
McHenry, near Baltimore. The bombardment lasted all night, but the
fort was so bravely defended that the flag was still floating over it when
morning came. Just before the bombardment began, Francis Scott Key
was sent to the admiral’s frigate to arrange for an exchange of prisoners
and was told to wait until the bombardment was over. All night he
watched the fort and by the first rays of morning light he saw the Stars
and Stripes still waving. Then, in his joy and pride, he wrote the stirring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
words of the song which is now known and loved by all Americans—“The
Star-Spangled Banner.”</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Relate the incident that called forth the poem. 2. What
“perilous fight” had taken place? 3. Where was the author during the
fight? 4. What had he seen at the “twilight’s last gleaming”? 5. Over what
ramparts was the flag streaming? 6. Which lines suggest why the poet
could not be sure that the flag was still there? 7. What sometimes “gave
proof” to him? 8. What finally disclosed the flag “in full glory”? 9.
What feelings do you think this certainty aroused in the watcher? 10.
Who made up “the foe’s haughty host”? 11. Find words that tell where the
foe was and that he had ceased firing. 12. What “war’s desolation” is
named in the third stanza? 13. What other war songs do you know? 14.
What other country’s national hymn do you know? 15. What purposes does
such a song serve?</p>

<h4>CITIZENSHIP</h4>

<p class="author">WILLIAM P. FRYE</p>

<p>Citizenship! What is citizenship? It has a <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1028">broader signification</a>
than you and I are apt to give it. Citizenship does not
mean alone that the man who possesses it shall be obedient to the
law, shall be kindly to his neighbors, shall regard the rights of
others, shall perform his <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1029">duties as juror</a>, shall, if the hour of peril
come, yield his time, his property, and his life to his country. It
means more than that. It means that his country shall protect
him in every right which the Constitution gives him. What right
has the Republic to demand his life, his property, in the hour of
peril, if, when his hour of peril comes, it fails him? A man died
in England a few years ago, Lord Napier of Magdala, whose death
reminded me of an <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1030">incident which illustrates</a> this, an incident
which gave that great lord his name. A few years ago King
Theodore of Abyssinia seized Captain Cameron, a British citizen,
and <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1031">incarcerated him</a> in a dungeon on the top of a mountain nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[581]</a></span>
thousand feet high. England demanded his release, and King
Theodore refused. England fitted out and sent on five thousand
English soldiers, and ten thousand Sepoys, debarked them on the
coast, marched them more than four hundred miles through swamp
and morass under a burning sun. Then they marched up the
mountain height, they scaled the walls, they broke down the iron
gates, they reached down into the dungeon, they took that one
British citizen like a <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1032">brand from the burning</a> and carried him
down the mountain side, <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1033">across the morass</a>, put him on board the
white-winged ship, and bore him away to England to safety.
That cost Great Britain millions of dollars, and it made General
Napier Lord Napier of Magdala.</p>

<p>Was not that a magnificent thing for a great country to do?
Only think of it! A country that has an eye sharp enough to see
away across the ocean, away across the morass, away up into the
mountain top, away down into the dungeon, one citizen, one of
her thirty millions, and then has an arm strong enough to reach
away across the ocean, away across the morass, away up the
mountain height and down into the dungeon and take that one and
bear him home in safety. Who would not live and die, too, for
the country that can do that? This country of ours is worth our
thought, our care, our labor, our lives. What a magnificent
country it is! What a Republic for the people, where all are
kings! Men of great wealth, of great rank, of great influence can
live without difficulty under <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1034">despotic power</a>; but how can you and
I, how can the average man endure the burdens it imposes? Oh,
this blessed Republic of ours stretches its hand down to men, and
lifts them up, while despotism puts its heavy hand on their heads
and presses them down! This blessed Republic of ours speaks to
every boy in the land, black or white, rich or poor, and asks him
to come up higher and higher. You remember that boy out here
on the prairie, the son of a widowed mother, poor, neglected perhaps
by all except the dear old mother. But the Republic did not
neglect him. The Republic said to that boy: “Boy, there is a
ladder: its foot is on the earth, its top is in the sky. Boy, go up.”
And the boy mounted that ladder rung by rung; by the rung of
the free schools, by the rung of the academy, by the rung of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
college, by the rung of splendid service in the United States Army,
by the rung of the United States House of Representatives, by the
rung of the United States Senate, by the rung of the Presidency of
the Great Republic, by the rung of a patient sickness and a heroic
death; until James A. Garfield is a name to be forever honored in
the history of our country.</p>

<p>Now, is not a Republic like that worth the <a href="#phrases92" title="List of phrases" id="ref1035">tribute of our conscience</a>?
Is it not entitled to our best thought, to our holiest
purpose?</p>

<p>Let us pledge ourselves to give it our loyal service and support
until every man in this Republic, black or white, shall be protected
in all the rights which the Constitution of the United States
bestows upon him.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biographical and Historical Note.</b> William Pierce Frye (1831-1911), an
eminent lawyer and statesman, was born at Lewiston, Maine. He was graduated
from Bowdoin College in 1850, and was a member of Congress from
1871 to 1881, and United States senator for Maine from 1881 to 1911.
After the death of Vice-President Hobart, and also after the death of
President McKinley, he acted as president <i lang="la">pro tempore</i> of the senate.</p>

<p>The Magdala affair is a striking example of what a country will do to
protect its citizens. Magdala, more properly Makdala, is a natural stronghold
in Abyssinia. The emperor Theodore of Abyssinia chose it as a
fortress and a prison. Having taken offense because a request that English
workmen and machinery be sent him was not promptly complied with,
Theodore seized the British consul, Captain C. D. Cameron, his suite, and
two other men, and imprisoned them at Magdala. Lieutenant-General
Robert Napier was sent to rescue the prisoners. For his services in this
expedition Napier received the thanks of Parliament, a pension, and a
peerage, with the title First Baron Napier of Magdala.</p>

<h4>THE CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON</h4>

<p class="author">THOMAS JEFFERSON</p>

<p>I think I knew General Washington intimately and thoroughly,
and were I called on to delineate his character, it should
be in terms like these:</p>

<p>His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very
first order; <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1036">his penetration strong</a>, though not so acute as that of
a Newton, Bacon, or Locke, and as far as he saw, no judgment
was ever sounder. It was slow in operation, being little aided by
<a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1037">invention or imagination</a>, but sure in conclusion. Hence the common
remark of his officers, of the advantage he derived from
councils of war, where, hearing all suggestions, he selected whatever
was best; and certainly no general ever planned his battles
more judiciously. But if <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1038">deranged during the course</a> of the action,
if any member of his plan was <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1039">dislocated by sudden circumstances</a>,
he was slow in readjustment. The consequence was that he often
failed in the field, and rarely against an enemy in station, as at
Boston and New York. He was incapable of fear, meeting personal
dangers with the calmest unconcern.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strongest feature in his character was prudence;
never acting until every circumstance, every consideration, was
maturely weighed; refraining if he saw a doubt, but, when once
decided, going through with his purpose whatever <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1040">obstacles opposed</a>.
His integrity was most pure, his justice the most inflexible
I have ever known, no motives of <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1041">interest or consanguinity</a>,
of friendship, or hatred, being able to <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1042">bias his decision</a>. He was,
indeed, in every sense of the words, a wise, a good, and a great
man. His temper was naturally irritable and high-toned; but
reflection and resolution had obtained a firm and <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1043">habitual ascendancy</a>
over it. If ever, however, it broke its bounds, he was most
tremendous in his wrath.</p>

<p>In his expenses he was honorable, but exact; <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1044">liberal in contribution</a>
to whatever promised utility, but frowning and unyielding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
on all <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1045">visionary projects</a> and all unworthy calls on his charity.
His heart was not warm in its affections; but he exactly calculated
every man’s value, and gave him a <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1046">solid esteem proportioned</a> to it.
His person, you know, was fine, his stature exactly what one could
wish, his deportment easy, erect, and noble; the best horseman of
his age, and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback.</p>

<p>Although in the circle of his friends, where he might be unreserved
with safety, he took a free share in conversation, his colloquial
talents were not above mediocrity, possessing neither
copiousness of ideas nor fluency of words. In public, when called
on for a sudden opinion, he was unready, short, and embarrassed.
Yet he wrote readily, <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1047">rather diffusely</a>, in an easy and correct
style. This he had acquired by conversation with the world, for
his education was merely reading, writing, and common arithmetic,
to which he added surveying at a later day.</p>

<p>His time was employed in action chiefly, reading little, and
that only in agriculture and English history. His correspondence
became necessarily extensive, and, with journalizing his agricultural
proceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within-doors.</p>

<p>On the whole, his character was, in its mass, perfect, in nothing
bad, in few points indifferent; and it may truly be said that never
did nature and fortune combine more perfectly to make a man
great, and to place him in the same constellation with whatever
worthies have merited from man an everlasting remembrance.</p>

<p>For his was the singular destiny and merit of leading the
armies of his country successfully through an <a href="#phrases93" title="List of phrases" id="ref1048">arduous war</a> for the
establishment of its independence; of conducting its councils
through the birth of a government, new in its forms and principles,
until it had settled down into a quiet and orderly train;
and of scrupulously obeying the laws through the whole of his
career, civil and military, of which the history of the world furnishes
no other example.</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), a native of Virginia, was
Governor of Virginia, Minister to France, Secretary of State in Washington’s
Cabinet, Vice-President, and President. He wrote the Declaration
of Independence and was the founder of the University of Virginia. Jefferson
was a ripe scholar, a good violinist, a skillful horseman, and an accurate
marksman with a rifle. His influence was clearly felt in the framing of the
Constitution, though he was in France at that time. His speeches were
sound in policy and clear in statement.</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. What peculiarly fitted Jefferson to describe the character
of Washington? 2. What conflict gave Washington an opportunity to show
his greatness? 3. How had Washington’s life prepared him to take advantage
of his opportunities? 4. Name the qualities, as given by Jefferson,
that made Washington so great a leader. 5. How did he show prudence?
Integrity? Justice? 6. From your readings can you give any instance in
which he showed fearlessness? 7. How did he show sureness in judgment?
8. What, in Jefferson’s opinion, was the strongest feature of Washington’s
character? 9. How does Jefferson summarize his estimate of Washington?
10. What quality especially characteristic of Lincoln is not mentioned in
this estimate, because it was lacking in Washington? 11. Give a summary
of the things Washington accomplished. 12. What part of this characterization
of Washington impressed you most. 13. Which of the qualities mentioned
would you most wish to possess?</p>

<h5>NOTES AND QUESTIONS</h5>

<p><b>Biography.</b> Richard Henry Stoddard (1825-1903), the son of a sea
captain, was born at Hingham, Mass. After the death of his father he
moved with his mother to New York City, where, after a short school life,
he began work in an iron foundry. He and Bayard Taylor became warm
friends, meeting once a week to talk of literary matters. His characterization
of Lincoln is regarded as a classic. He wrote both prose and poetry
and became noted as a literary critic. He is the author of “Homes and
Haunts of Our Elder Poets.”</p>

<p><b>Discussion.</b> 1. Tell what you can of the author, noting anything in his
life that was common to that of Lincoln. 2. Name the qualities that the
poet says made Lincoln “one of Nature’s masterpieces.” 3. What does
“homely” mean as used in the first line? 4. From your study of pictures
of Lincoln what other words can you suggest to describe his features? 5.
Explain the meaning of “cunning with the pen.” 6. Repeat any of Lincoln’s
famous sayings you know. 7. What does the eighth line tell you of
Lincoln’s character? 8. How did his humor help him to win? 9. Why
was the “burden of the Commonwealth” so great and why was it laid on
his shoulders? 10. Toward what did the road tend “suddenly downward,”
and how did Lincoln meet the situation created by Secession? 11. What
reasons can you give for calling him a “Benefactor of the Race”? 12.
Compare the achievements of Lincoln with those of Washington. 13.
Which do you think the better description, that written by Stoddard or
that by Jefferson?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
